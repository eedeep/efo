            "content": "<p class=\"p1\">The Housemuseum challenges the assumption that the home is a private entity, opening its doors to the public.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Music, theatre, painting, sculpture, dance or cinema can become forces that move beyond collective experience and veer quickly into the realm of passion. The possession of art and its visibility are a constant source of debate. While the liberation of high art out of the stately homes of the Victorian era and into the gallery for all to see has its obvious benefits for the general public, it often removes the work from its intended context. Viewing a family portrait in a huge room with thirty other portraits corrupts the scale of the experience and perhaps removes the enjoyment from the education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">In the domestic scene, the role of art is often limited to the purchase of a painting for a special occasion, or a print that complements the decor of a room, or perhaps as an experiment in collecting art as a pastime. In recent years, the commodification of art as an investment or as part of a self-funded superannuation package has confused the notion of why you might collect art. At its best, good art is purchased by people who love it &ndash; but how they choose to display it in their private realm is an entirely personal agenda. Far away from the white gloves and stale air of curators and galleries, owners of good art hang it in a manner that allows them to enjoy it every day. Occasionally, generous individuals or families open their homes to the public to allow their collection to be seen. This is important not just because of the chance to see the work, but more critically to see the art in a house &ndash; an intimate, particularly curated personal space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Corbett and Yueji Lyon have embraced the proposition to open their home and their collection, creating the Lyon Housemuseum in the Melbourne suburb of Kew. The idea of the Housemuseum is far more eighteenth century than twenty-first. This access to a personal collection of important work has seen many houses around the world become small galleries. The Sir John Soane&rsquo;s Museum in London, the Frick Collection in New York and, closer to home, John and Sunday Reed&rsquo;s Heide II at Heide Museum of Modern Art in Melbourne. In each case, the collection has a direct relationship with the architecture, where the complexities of space form a dialogue with the pieces it contains.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">At the Lyon Housemuseum, it is the shift in scale that is most compelling. The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; function of the house is wrapped around two volumes for art, one black and one white. The black box is closed and almost impenetrable, designed for projection and video work that needs control of light. The white cube is open to light and occupation, with balconies that look down into the space, allowing multiple views of each work. Between these two spaces is a wonderful collection of rooms, some long and thin, some vast and high, some tiny and intimate, all weaving a rich matrix of domestic stuff among the expansive collection of Australian contemporary art. The Australian bit is important &ndash; for over thirty years, the Lyons have systematically collected good Australian art, pieces that have become exemplars of this period in Australian art history. <br /> Howard Arkley, Callum Morton, Patricia Piccinini, Tim Maguire, Peter Atkins and Daniel von Sturmer, to name but a few, are represented <br /> in the collection.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">This is not an ostentatious exercise, but a considered exploration of how a substantial collection of art might be integrated into a residence. The spaces seem in constant flux between the dominance of the art and the prominence of the architecture. Occasionally the balance is uncomfortable, with a piece struggling for room in its host space, but this only heightens the nature of the investigation. Some spaces are purpose designed for an artwork; others welcome a particular scale of work. Integral to this exploration is how the house might function in a public context when opened for visitors or researchers. In response, the architecture carefully considers the privacy of the house&rsquo;s more intimate points (for example, the bathrooms and children&rsquo;s bedrooms). The result is a deep plan layered with clever circulation. Elaborate joinery units conceal small works as artefacts, with doors pivoting and panels sliding to reveal the precious contents inside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Externally the Housemuseum is a surprisingly restrained object considering the highly expressive institutional and educational work of Lyons, the architectural practice Corbett has with his brothers Carey and Cameron Lyon. Ribbed zinc cladding undulates over a glazed ribbon of glass that connects the sculpture courtyard with the work inside. The perimeter wall of the corner block that holds the Housemuseum manifests the wit of the authors, with the name of the two streets pixelated into the brick pattern.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">In contrast, the interior is lined with plywood panels that fold from ceiling to wall and into the joinery elements. A texture appears across the ply that, on closer inspection, reveals a collection of quotes, texts and conversations that seems to describe the spirit and process of creating the building. In fact, although it can never be read, the text forms the word <em>art</em>, embedding the intention in the soul of the house.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">This gesture reveals the real tension in this project &ndash; those moments when the architecture is seen as a layer of the artwork. The architecture, through space and material, curates both how the house is lived in and how it aids understanding and, fundamentally, enjoyment of the art within.&nbsp;</p>",

            "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>We present developed images of the seventeen \u201cWhen\u201d scenarios to be shown in Venice, and Lee Stickells looks at the catalogue to consider these speculations on the future.&#160;</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although I can find no mention of it, I hope the Australian pavilion&#160;</span>at the 2010 Venice Biennale has a snack bar. I\u2019ve only got the catalogue by which to gauge the architecture exhibition, but it certainly looks like Jaffas and choc bombs would be the ideal accompaniments. Now + When: Australian Urbanism is projected (literally) by its creative directors, Ivan Rijavec and John Gollings, as a technologically dazzling display of 3D stereographic images and animation, augmented by an immersive soundscape. Australia\u2019s last biennale outing was about impressing through an \u201cabundance\u201d of architectural models and thinking; this time it\u2019s about overwhelming through \u201cvisceral spectacle\u201d.&#160;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The image on page six of the Now catalogue sums up the approach. It shows a group of architectural illuminati gathered at a preview screening, 3D goggles on; their faces are tilted upward toward the projection out of shot to the right. Something in that combination of the distinctive glasses and posture reminds me of a well-known image of a 1950s cinema audience, all wearing 3D glasses. I\u2019m particularly familiar with its use on the paperback cover to Guy Debord\u2019s <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>. The resonance points me to the most obvious criticism that might be levelled against Now + When: that it is focused on the spectacular, on a distracting, seductive entertainment that works against critically engaging with the issues faced by urban Australia. The suspicion on this count isn\u2019t eased by Gollings\u2019 attempts, on the one hand, to claim a new, revelatory role for the thrilling stereoscopic views he has harnessed and his admission, on the other hand, that such images \u201clie\u201d \u2013 concealing many problems in their distance and sheen.&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nonetheless, it\u2019s hard not to be swayed by Gollings\u2019 enthusiastic and beguiling recounting of the production process (the catalogue essay on this having already been published in <em>AA</em> May/June 2010). <br />\r\nI\u2019m also cautious about pre-empting the experience of the pavilion, based only on the catalogue material available to me. In any case, I\u2019m more interested and concerned with the When material. The speculative architectural imaginary, the utopian impulse that it draws on, seems a pertinent field to engage at this point in history.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When 2050+ was developed through competition, from images and drawings submitted by Australian architects. \u201cVisionary and theoretical approaches, expressing directions and aims beyond current imaginations of the future\u201d were encouraged, and the results are deliberately provocative, even utopian. The catalogue puts it: \u201cThe result has been a cyberspace of creative speculation that oscillates from theoretical approaches to pure fantasy, exploding the urban debate into a visceral spectacle that defies rational analysis.\u201d Beyond the hyperbole, there is a serious and worthwhile impulse at work here. The utopian project is an important means of modelling alternatives to the way things are, in order to force some sort of engagement with them. Ernst Bloch described it elegantly: \u201cUtopian consciousness wants to look far into the distance, but ultimately only in order to penetrate the darkness so near it.\u201d</span><span class=\"s2\">1</span><span class=\"s1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, do the speculative urban scenarios developed and gathered in the catalogue have the power to conjure different worlds? Are they radical in modelling other ways of being, in the face of Australia\u2019s current demographic, environmental, economic, social and political tensions? Yes and no. In his When catalogue essay Craig Bremner suggests the scenarios featured \u201cdo not demand new cities or new urban scenarios. Rather, they ask us to design new living models, new ways of being together.\u201d I would argue that they do the opposite. Overwhelmingly, the catalogue\u2019s collected visions depict urban projects \u2013 city structures, technologies and forms \u2013 that leave social and political transformation, the critical question of structuring how we live together, aside. The images are provocative but the scenarios are often underwhelming.&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The seventeen \u201cgraphic predictions\u201d presented in the catalogue, curated by the creative directors from 129 competition submissions, form an all too familiar ecology of contemporary future-visioning. Like the crowded evolutionary trees for architecture that Charles Jencks created in <em>Architecture 2000 and Beyond</em>, these predictions form a swirling, homeostatic system from the same constituent parts. In various combinations and permutations, we can find: \u201corganic\u201d, algorithmic structures; large-scale public movement systems that negate the car; compact urban forms (typically dense and vertical); urban agriculture; infrastructural mega-structures; renewable energy systems and environmental technologies (for example, solar power and rainwater harvesting); form driven by demographic and environmental modelling; and recognizable tropes of architectural futurism (Lebbeus Woods parasites, Yona Friedman mega-structures, floating cities). Dramatic though the images might be, I find it disconcerting that, if the fantastical forms and airships were stripped away, most of the scenarios would please the average New Urbanist. Is this as radical as Australia\u2019s architecture gets?&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some of the visions are simply dull \u2013 tired Arcadian images or hoary clich\u00e9s that seem neither to offer incisive meditations on Australia\u2019s urban future nor to come close to \u201cvisceral spectacle\u201d. Alternatively, some of the scenarios offer more evocative, open-ended and productive imagery, but only if their scenarios are set aside. For instance, Saturation City\u2019s waterlogged urban enclaves are captured in simultaneously intriguing and disturbing images. These perhaps depict a wildly extrapolated outcome of the fragmentation and privatization already at work in our metropolises. Multiplicity\u2019s evocative topographical layers, floating over Melbourne\u2019s city centre, might be populated by all sorts of unforetold, parallel societies. However, the scenario text is corralled in an imaginary assembled from this year\u2019s concerns: media screens, mass transit, urban agriculture and renewable energy.&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As Aaron Betsky has put it: \u201cArchitecture is a fiction \u2026 Some of the most powerful pieces of architecture do not exist in buildings. We inhabit them through stories, whether they are myths, fiction or poetry.\u201d</span><span class=\"s2\">2</span><span class=\"s1\"> The problem for Now + When is that, for all the elaborate drama of the presentation techniques, the narratives are too often leaden. Why is this, and what is the significance? It may be worth considering that what is often most revealing about utopian vision is not what is said (or shown) but what cannot be said \u2013 \u201cwhat does not register on the narrative apparatus\u201d.</span><span class=\"s2\">3</span><span class=\"s1\"> For an exhibition at an international biennale, which aims to represent the very best of Australia\u2019s architectural thinking (and, presumably, a distinctively Australian mode of thinking), it is telling that the suburb is largely absent from the scenarios. Despite Australia\u2019s essentially suburban (rather than urban) quality, the focus is almost entirely on city centres. The suburb is quietly sidelined in these visions; it is ignored, superseded by dense urban form or replaced by verdant landscape. It is a lacuna in the overall discussion that points to the most contentious, and undoubtedly important, urban debate Australia must have.&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One scenario that does offer something like a suburban vision for Australia\u2019s future is Symbiotic City. Tellingly, it draws on the writing of William Gibson, adapting&#160; it to elucidate the continuous carpet of intertwined rural and urban that makes up \u201cNew Hobart\u201d.</span><span class=\"s2\">4</span><span class=\"s1\"> This is the most evocative and exciting text in the catalogue:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Swift had</em> walked slowly forward, into that neon maw and all that patchwork carnival of scavenged surfaces, in perfect awe. Fairyland. Rain-silvered plywood, broken marble from forgotten banks, corrugated plastic, polished brass, sequins, painted canvas, mirrors, chrome gone dull and peeling in the salt air. So many things, too much for the reeling eye \u2026 <em>A becoming-familiar juxtaposition</em> [\u2026] In the distance a wingless carcass of a 747 housed the kitchens of nine Thai restaurants.\u201d</span><span class=\"s2\">5</span><span class=\"s1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gibson\u2019s work demonstrates the power of speculative fiction to extrapolate from current conditions and hypothesize new ways of being together. The recent tradition of urban re-imagining that Gibson sits within (J. G. Ballard probably its most well known figure) has also had a powerful influence on the way architects speculate about future urban landscapes. This relationship points to what I anticipate is the best way (should any of us get the chance) to view the Now + When exhibition in all its 3D stereoscopic glory: accompanied by some serious speculative fiction. Don the active shutter goggles to enjoy the thrill and dynamism of the When projections, but read some Ballard, Gibson or Neal Stephenson in parallel. My suspicion is that the juxtapositions will be more inspiring and the experience more provocative. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Lee Stickells</em> is a senior lecturer in architecture and urban design at the University of Sydney.&#160;<br />\r\n</span></p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Lahz Nimmo Architects in association with Wilson Architects brings the academic and the clinical together for the most recent addition to UNSW.</strong></p><p>Universities across Australia have embarked on major campus development programs in the past decade, with much of this building boom housing newly established research partnerships. UNSW\u2019s Lowy Cancer Research Centre is the most recent to be completed, bringing teams of researchers in adult cancer from the Faculty of Medicine together with the Children\u2019s Cancer Institute Australia. There are significant cost savings in sharing expensive equipment and laboratories but this is only one motivation in co-locating research teams. The higher aspiration is that groups of previously isolated researchers will find common ground, discuss their work and make breakthroughs. The question for architecture centres on the problem of spatially supporting planned research as well as serendipitous exchange.</p><p>The Lowy Cancer Research Centre was won by Lahz Nimmo Architects in association with Wilson Architects, through an invited competition process. Wilson Architects\u2019 contribution was focused on satisfying the first ambition, the provision of quality laboratories to facilitate research \u2013 the practice previously worked with John Wardle Architects on the Queensland Brain Institute. Both the Lowy and QBI are primarily laboratory buildings (the Lowy has four floors of P2 laboratories) and both buildings benefited from Wilson Architects\u2019 expertise in the sensible resolution of parallel zones of equipment, benches and write-up. The researchers I spoke with are happy with the flexibility and operational aspects of their laboratories and the ease of moving between floors via an internal P2 lift and stairs.</p><p>To fulfil a laboratory classification, solar penetration is strictly eschewed in the designated spaces and the decision was made to keep the band of equipment to the north and write-up to the south of the laboratories. Consequently, researchers always have the relief of a pleasant view of a mature garden \u2013 a view enriched by stepping up the ceiling height to the south, making large full-height windows possible. The southern facade is an attractive composition of glazing and vertical bands of green aluminium composite panel, while the northern facade, protecting the equipment rooms behind, is heavy and less visually satisfying. Unhelpfully, the project floor area increased by 30 percent during the design process, and this eliminated any potential for setting the northern facade further back from the street. Attempts to relieve the overall bulk with punched out rooms are further compromised by the incomplete state of the project. The adjacent Faculty of Medicine building will soon be renovated \u2013 again by Lahz Nimmo in association with Wilson Architects \u2013 and this includes a new facade to the north that with luck will see the public face of the building better resolved. In its current state it is somewhat schizophrenic; the public face of the project is at odds with its welcoming and lively interiors.</p><p>The challenge of getting around four hundred researchers, led by professors who are regularly out of the building and in the hospital, to intermingle is the key ambition of the project and it is in these attempts to sponsor conviviality that the building gets interesting. Firstly, the project substitutes monumental and complete form for a more porous and open-ended architecture with physical links and views to other buildings on and off campus.

In its current state it is somewhat schizophrenic; the public face of the project is at odds with its welcoming and lively interiors.building form is literally and metaphorically concerned with connection and bridging. Secondly, the project thickens and augments the corridor \u2013 the traditional space of academic socializing and gossip \u2013 using it to form a distributed network of informal kitchens and lounges, semi-open-plan work areas and programmed event spaces. The core of these informal social spaces bridges the upper levels of the new building with the old Wallace Wurth Medical Faculty and takes a diagonal path between the two that approximates a natural inclination for walking. Forming an inhabited bridge, this is in turn used to frame what has become a major pedestrian entrance to this end of the campus, as well as to both buildings and the Michael Birt Gardens beyond. With its foyer and circulation located adjacent to the existing medical faculty (rather than at the west end as originally briefed), the project has been able to generate a positive experience of social exchange between new and old elements, but also in and out of the campus. The connection between UNSW and its context is more than symbolic, for the relationship between clinical and academic work is close.</p><p>The foyer is an expanded space that reaches vertically through the six floors of the building, its perimeter shifting to introduce a dynamic of interpenetration. From the photographs I anticipated that the foyer would be a monochromatic space of green, green, green. In reality, there is a lot of green, but it is balanced by planes of white, walls of timber, dark grey floors and furniture that introduces orange and brown. Indeed, there is a remarkable attention to delivering a tactile, colourful and carefully thought through interior of purpose-built cabinetry and flexibility. The vibe is that of a bar and lounge, not an institution devoted to science and bench space, yet these are bars and lounges that can easily be reconfigured for presentations and meetings, and are equally comfortable for a lone researcher with her sandwich.</p><p>It has been evident since the beginning of the project that the success of Lahz Nimmo Architects and Wilson Architects\u2019 winning proposal lies in a clear organizational schema that manages to encompass the strategic ambitions of the university as well as the detailed technical requirements of the researchers. The key elements \u2013 views to the gardens, intense use of circulation as a social condenser, upper-level connections to the Wallace Wurth and a skewed western end that addressed the campus and a major eastern entry \u2013 have survived negotiation and compromise and, more specifically, the builder\u2019s value management process. Materials and details have changed to accommodate the demands of value management, but it is only in the northern facade that one feels that this has in any way lessened the outcome. Most importantly, the informal social spaces that are typically the most vulnerable to pressures in the process from briefing to occupation (given that they do not have a quantitative brief) have been preserved and are working. In similar research buildings it is almost always the informal and formal social spaces that users complain about \u2013 atria that are too cold, hot, noisy or exposed to comfortably lounge in, reading and discussion areas with empty shelves that were meant to be shared libraries, kitchens that remain unused. For the Lowy Cancer Research Centre, these spaces have been so successful that the users immediately exceeded the provision of refrigerators. It is a credit to the architects that they are now designing additions to the kitchens to accommodate their popularity.</p><p>Sandra Kaji-O\u2019Grady is professor of architecture at the University of Sydney.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Responding to the environmental and client context of each project, this practice has an expanding folio of individualized homes.</strong></p>\r\n<p>While only in their mid thirties, Albert Mo and Eid Goh, the directors of Architects EAT, have been running the firm for more than a decade. The practice was founded by Albert and Eid and a third director, since departed, after studying together at the University of Melbourne.</p>\r\n<p>Their priorities were clear from the beginning. &ldquo;When you start an architectural business, you have to decide early on if you want the money or if you want the reputation,&rdquo; says Albert, laughing. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really say both. But while sustaining a little income, one big thing we said to ourselves was that design is important.&rdquo; Years later, this focus on design has seen the firm develop a reputation for finely wrought houses that are paradoxically novel and yet reliant on fundamentals that would make an old architect smile.</p>\r\n<p>Individual houses are important to the practice, although they also work on commercial and higher-density housing projects in Australia and abroad. &ldquo;Houses have an intrinsic quality,&rdquo; explains Albert. &ldquo;A client comes to you and entrusts their life savings. In each single house our motivation is what we can explore, how we can explore the ideas we like.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And what of those houses? The first EAT project to gain press interest was Albert&rsquo;s own extension to his older house in the inner-Melbourne suburb of Richmond (Kelso House). &ldquo;When you are doing your own house, a lot is about the budget. At that time we really didn&rsquo;t have too much money, but we still wanted to do something special because it was a vehicle for us to show our design. A lot of ideas came through, but of course a lot of ideas also mean money. It became an interesting project by distilling the ideas, pared back down to the essential things that we wanted, to maximize the potential of the site.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The signature feature of this house is the horizontal strip skylights in the living space. &ldquo;In this case we wanted to bring natural light deep into the house. It&rsquo;s a Corbusian idea, registering the light as the day changes.&rdquo; The success of this feature has seen it resurface in later houses.</p>\r\n<p>Light remains a preoccupation in general, and their Hawthorn house plays with light both internally and externally. I ask about other common threads in their work. Albert replies that &ldquo;one thing we talk about early on, in housing projects, is the response to the context. Not just the physical context, but the human context. The client may be a really flamboyant person, for example, and their personality is always ingrained. The way the client talks, the way they present themselves, really influences the mood of the project.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In the Windsor Loft project, Albert and Eid were deeply influenced by the client&rsquo;s photographs and furniture, sculptures and art. They were also struck by the extroverted way their client presented himself, and this too fed indirectly into the project, perhaps most notably with the choice of the striking red plastic facade.</p>\r\n<p>The Elm and Willow House had a very different client, with a very different result. The project is an extension to a typical double-fronted Edwardian and the renovation takes the form of a U-shaped, glazed, steel and concrete pavilion wrapped around two existing trees. &ldquo;This client was &lsquo;design mature.&rsquo; The project was for a young couple with a two-year-old child. One of the couple is an industrial designer, very aware of design in an international sense. They talked about projects by John Pawson and Tadao Ando. Normally if you say concrete in residential you would be fighting a battle, but not in this case.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The solution for the couple was to provide a living and kitchen space in the rear, as a contrast to the darker, more enclosed Edwardian at the front. In keeping with the couple&rsquo;s interests, the living spaces are non-traditional in the sense of being relatively &ldquo;unprogrammed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Instead of a living room with a television, they have deliberately decided to have just a couple of low seats and that&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s very improvised.&rdquo; This client was also &ldquo;happy to forgo the desire for multiple bathrooms&rdquo; and other typical trappings of the contemporary house. As associate James Coombe would later say in response to a question about trends they had observed in house design, &ldquo;We try to push a slightly alternative lifestyle, I guess.&rdquo; The Elm and Willow House certainly meets this criterion.</p>\r\n<p>A new project at Skenes Creek required a similar editing of the client&rsquo;s requirements. The so-called Puzzle House led the team to question the real needs of the occupants of a holiday house. &ldquo;Holiday houses always seem to come with a massive brief. We said, hang on &ndash; you go there maybe five days a month, why do you need to live like you are in the suburbs? So the whole house is small, 7.5 by 7.5 by 7.5 metres.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>My conversation with the Architects EAT team is a relaxed affair, and there is a palpable sense of ease between the three architects at the table. I have a glimpse of what it must be like to engage them as a client. Eid expresses it simply. &ldquo;Whoever comes in, we treat them the same. You just be as humble as you can.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I discover that this attitude also applies to their sub-consultants and the builders who create their projects. &ldquo;We definitely have to collaborate with the builders on our projects. The concrete at the Elm and Willow House is a good example &ndash; luckily the client was keen on prototyping, as we and the builder hadn&rsquo;t done it before. The engineer also played an enormous part.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Albert points to this as a generational characteristic. &ldquo;The difference is that the older generation of architects were the ultimate head of construction, up there ignoring advice from the builder, and our generation is more about learning from people who actually use tools every day, who have the craftsmanship to put things together. I mean, we have differences, but 70 percent of the time I would say that they are right.&rdquo;</p>",

The Bloom Series is the most recent result of her explorations \u2013 a group of homewares and furniture pieces that continue to unfurl, to bloom, from a palm-sized, three-sided, generating object she has called a \u201cpixel.\u201d</p><p>The Bloom Series was born out of a group exhibition where each contributing artist was required to depict his or her own shape or silhouette. Ever willing to submit herself to artworks \u201cthat nearly kill me,\u201d Waterson handmade a suspended silhouette of herself constructed from 700 polypropylene pixels. Inspired by the results, she ramped up the scale. Working with pixels thirty centimetres high, Waterson built a suspended, sculptural ceiling.</p><p>Inevitably, out of this process of crafting the same object over and over at different scales, other forms emerged. Working with what Waterson calls \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d forms of the pixel, she clustered, sliced, mirrored and stretched to create different objects at different scales. So far the Bloom Series has unfurled a small, faceted metal vessel entitled Clove that is fabricated from a split female form, and an elegant ply fruit bowl \u2013 \u00bd Tilt \u2013 made from a lateral split in a cluster of female forms. Mirroring the form of the fruit bowl created a dynamic magazine rack entitled Tilt Form and stretching the geometry of this shape upwards created a ply stool with a faceted, concave seat, Lift Stool. The ceiling has rotated to become Pixel Screen, made from recycled corflute, and a series of richly coloured objects, Fruit Pixels, comprise the baby of the range. Made from recycled, coloured acrylic, the spiky, jewel-like objects nostalgically recall a collection of coloured glassware owned by Waterson\u2019s grandmother.</p><p>For Waterson the Bloom Series is a deliciously infinite project that offers her a vehicle with which to explore the boundaries of particular materials, to build collaborative relationships with local fabricators and to exercise her mind when looking to the next shift in geometry or scale. As her mind continues to whirr, expect to see future editions in new materials or colours and fresh forms emerging from the folds of the existing series.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>The Australian dream of home ownership has not traditionally embraced prefabricated housing, but could the move toward sustainability change that? This discussion is followed by a presentation by Arkit on the prefabricated EcoStudio that was recently on display at Melbourne\u2019s State of Design festival.</strong></p><p>Our love of real estate has traditionally focused on detached houses built on separate, usually quarter-acre, blocks of land. Solidity and permanence are important qualities \u2013 brickwork is the preferred material, even if only for the outer, visible layer. Size is important too \u2013 the bigger, the better, of course. And styles, at least for the ready-built market, tend to speak of our colonial past or our romantic ideals of European landscapes (Tuscany is the usual favourite). Lightweight construction might be tolerated for a holiday house \u2013 a beach shack in Australia or a \u201cbach\u201d in New Zealand \u2013 while apartments are considered an investment or an option for retirement. This love of houses has meant that while Australia is an urbanized country, its cities are low-density \u2013 some of the lowest in the world.</p><p>This creates two key challenges for improving the sustainability of the built environment. First, to improve the efficiency of water and energy collection and use in suburban houses. This is being done \u2013 if slowly \u2013 through incentives such as rebates for rainwater tanks and solar hot water systems. Second, to improve the efficiency of the infrastructure that serves these houses. This means making better use of transport, energy and water networks that are already in place, rather than building new ones. The way to do this is to increase density: to use activity centres and urban infill to create smaller, more connected dwellings that celebrate moderation. And prefabrication might just be the way to do it.</p><p>Houses are not like other consumer goods. While modern architecture changed the appearance of the built environment, it didn\u2019t have the same effect on the building industry. The advantages of production-line factories and global supply networks that brought appliances and other goods into our homes had much less effect on the homes themselves. It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying: the twentieth century is filled with experiments in factory-built housing, the most notable being Buckminster Fuller\u2019s Dymaxion, all promising to make houses as easy to buy as a motor car. But, while owning a motor car was considered a sign of prosperity, living in a prefab house was not. Their small size and lightweight materials spoke instead of welfare austerity, and their portability implied they were in constant danger of being repossessed.</p><p>But today\u2019s prefabricated houses are different. No longer resembling mining site sheds, they are increasingly being designed by groovy young architects. Playful variations of an overall rectilinear geometry \u2013 amenable to factory production \u2013 give design identity similar to that achieved through mass customization. Renewable materials dominate, resulting in a mix of industrial and eco aesthetics. Factory production means minimal waste, while portability is a useful feature for a generation familiar with nomadic work practices and cheap global travel. Modules are usually small, enabling efficient energy and water use. More importantly, site installation means energy, water supply and waste disposal can be facilitated either through network services or on-site systems. This can make the users more aware of \u2013 and responsible for \u2013 the ongoing resource usage in a way that might not happen with \u201cburied\u201d services.</p><p>Housing affordability is a key issue \u2013 prefabricated houses might be the best way for the next generation to get into the market. Instead of buying house and land packaged together (either from a developer or as an existing dwelling), home owners might buy a prefabricated house and then lease a site to live on. A whole new market could emerge as the yards of suburban Australia are made available to tenants able to bring their own home with them. Alternatively, eco-villages could be created for new home owners to occupy until they could afford their own site. Around activity centres or along existing transport corridors, sites could be made available above existing commercial or light-industrial sites.</p><p>Prefabrication provides an opportunity to improve the environmental performance of new houses. It can provide smaller, more efficient homes to meet the demands of a growing population, a new way to change the rules of home ownership and, more importantly, to increase the density of our cities.</p><p>The Australian dream of home ownership has not traditionally embraced prefabricated housing, but could the move toward sustainability change that? This discussion is followed by a presentation by Arkit on the prefabricated EcoStudio that was recently on display at Melbourne\u2019s State of Design festival.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Arkit is a hybrid prefabrication company combining architectural services, research and development, project management and manufacturing. Arkit designs and manufactures factory-built buildings using a sustainable wall-panel system, which provides integrated insulation to protect the interior environment from thermal variation while also providing structural stability to ensure a durable building.</p><p>The Arkit construction system utilizes the natural properties of timber in manufacturing \u2013 it is lightweight, it uses off-the-shelf standards and practices, it has lower embodied energy and lower carbon emissions than other common building materials, and it is economical, renewable and harvested from a sustainable source. Each panel and window interlocks to form a rigid wall system. Constructed in a factory, each panel is crafted to precision tolerances and quality standards.</p><p>The Arkit panel is manufactured using unused short lengths of western red cedar as the external cladding \u2013 a sustainably managed natural resource with exceptional beauty, built-in resistance to harsh environmental conditions and inherent insulating properties. This is combined with a plantation-harvested hoop pine plywood interior lining to create a building that sits harmoniously in its environment.</p><p>The Arkit is economical and takes a fraction of the normal time to manufacture, deliver and erect. It offers clients a sustainable architectural solution where design, time and budget expectations are known prior to the installation of the building, offering a certainty and quality that are sometimes missing in traditional construction processes.</p><p>The EcoStudio is just one example of a building built using the prefabricated Arkit system. This single-bedroom fifty-square-metre building is assembled in our factory and delivered to site complete with kitchen, bathroom and all the wiring and plumbing ready for connection.</p><p>An integral part of the design is its environmental engineering, starting with the variable services hub at the rear of the building. The hub is fully accessible and contains the hot water unit, electrical meter and switchboard, grey water system and telecommunications node. The hub can also accommodate options such as a solar hot water unit and solar electricity to suit the local and specific client requirements.</p><p>The EcoStudio can be engineered to respond to different climates and to adapt to the absence of civil infrastructure, providing intelligent options for sustainable living. The sustainability strategy and philosophy for adaptable building infrastructure has been developed in partnership with Tai Hollingsbee of GHD. It represents a considered, integrated approach between architecture and engineering as an exemplar of sustainable design.</p><p>GHD optimized the building envelope in response to detailed thermal, energy and comfort analysis of the building design. The life-cycle cost analysis shows a marked benefit in long-term running costs for the building over traditional building alternatives. This adaptable building systems strategy can also enable off-grid installations with the potential for an independent, zero-carbon mode of living.</p><p>Arkit standard passive environmental features include external sunscreen devices concealed in the external walls of the building, cross-flow ventilation, double glazing and insulated floors and ceilings. The EcoStudio displayed at this year\u2019s State of Design Festival in Melbourne featured a green roof provided by the School of Land and Environment Green Roof Research Program at the University of Melbourne, which is ideal as a way of limiting solar gain and mitigating stormwater run-off and air pollution in urban environments.</p><p>The EcoStudio in standard specification is expected to achieve a First Rate 5 rating of 6.1 stars in Victoria \u2013 well ahead of current standards and above the requirement for 6 stars for all new residential buildings in 2011. The EcoStudio is envisioned as a residential accommodation for the urban backyard or rural block, for temporary accommodation, weekenders, eco tourism and for home office or studio environments.</p>",

The NSW-based husband and wife architectural duo of Russell and Carolyn McFarland spent years designing other people\u2019s homes before they began their own, but the time was well spent.</p><p>\u201cSometimes we draw things that we don\u2019t really agree with because it\u2019s the client\u2019s particular wish,\u201d says Russell. However, that process has been helping them \u201csubconsciously develop ideas\u201d of how they\u2019d do their own place. When the time came, those ideas were \u201csomewhat solidified and quite happily very similar between Carolyn and myself,\u201d Russell says.</p><p>The result is a home they love. One of the nice surprises for the McFarland family is how easily they can spend the day in and around the house, drifting in and out.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get cabin fever as we\u2019ve found in other, more traditionally built houses we\u2019ve lived in,\u201d says Russell. \u201cIt\u2019s just a nice house to hang around in.\u201d</p><h4>Light and simple</h4><p>From the outside, Tallowwood Ridge Residence presents as one clean skin punctured by very dramatic and wide linear openings. It seems to float above the slope.</p><p>\u201cOne consistent thing in our work is the way the building is articulated over the levels, which allows the upper, lightweight, inhabited section to float over that solid foundation section,\u201d says Russell.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s expressed in materials and colour. Lightweight materials allow you to be much more expressive with openings \u2013 and larger scale openings \u2013 than if you had brickwork.\u201d</p><p>Russell points out that a lot of the innovations in their designs aren\u2019t space-age technologies, just the refining of traditional materials into something that\u2019s sustainable and increasingly useful.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t go for a lot of fancy materials. We use direct, available and practical ones, partly because they fit into people\u2019s skill bases,\u201d Russell says. \u201cYou\u2019re not paying through the nose for specialist trades. And that covers everything, from cladding to window technology developments. It\u2019s low-tech and simple.\u201d</p><h4>L over square</h4><p>While the materials the McFarlands favour are low-tech and simple, there\u2019s a trend in their designs to create buildings with long rectangular footprints instead of square ones. This means there\u2019s a greater surface area to floor area ratio, which can be more expensive to build.</p><p>To help compensate, the overall size of the McFarlands\u2019 home was based on the sizes of the panels of Scyon\u2122 Matrix\u2122 cladding used for most of the exterior. This meant the frame construction was more efficient, as it was based on the joints of the cladding, as well as reducing panel wastage.</p><p>\u201cThe dimensions of the building are almost a module of the panel,\u201d Russell says.</p><p>He feels that the benefits of the rectangular plan outweigh the negatives, if you can afford it.</p><p>\u201cIt means all the rooms have greater access to light and ventilation. In this instance the L-shape, with its greater exterior facade area, also worked better on the block. We find they generally do, because you\u2019re not putting a dumpy square on the block, leaving you with the marginal gaps around and a rectangle to the rear.</p><p>\u201cIf it then means that the area of the house itself is smaller to compensate for that greater surface area, then all the better!\u201d</p><h4>Design Awards</h4><p>Tallowwood Ridge Residence was an entrant in the 2010 Look Home Green Design Awards, created to recognise and reward the best in sustainable and affordable residential design across Australia.

            "content": "<p><strong>The architecture of then and now is fused with a blend of excitement and assured restraint at this reimagined homestead in southern Tasmania.</strong></p><p>Trial Bay House is exceptional on several levels. Located on a rural property south of Hobart, overlooking Bruny Island and the D\u2019Entrecasteaux Channel, it is sited in the teeth of the sublime.</p><p>James Jones, a former director of Hobart firm HBV Architects, has carried out a complete reorganization of an existing dwelling, designed nearly forty years ago by Ray Heffernan. He has added a new living pavilion and garage, enlarged a small courtyard and converted a verandah into a glazed corridor room.</p><p>The architecture of then and now is fused with a blend of excitement and assured restraint. The new \u201cchannel room,\u201d separated from the main house, is an abstraction in precast concrete of a cinematographer\u2019s camera. This linked pod pays homage to absent friends who knew how to maximize the impact of a magnificent site, Le Corbusier and Luis Barragan.</p><p>Steeply pitched gable roofs of the original house have been retained. The contrasting architectural styles of raw concrete orthogonal geometry appended to the old \u201chomestead\u201d form of painted masonry, elegant and iconic, is arresting upon arrival. A long and circuitous driveway sweeps out of the trees and the house is suddenly before you. The siting of the addition thrusting towards the view has the significance of a sacristy linked to a cathedral, a renaissance assertion of the major building\u2019s \u201cGothicness.\u201d</p><p>The channel room provides an extra living space, offering sanctuary to parents if the impact of teenaged children is temporarily dominant in an open-planned house. It is equipped with a north-facing, openable glazed wall to admit the sun in winter. A panorama of Bruny Island and the D\u2019Entrecasteaux Channel through the east wall is uninterrupted by window framing but punctuated by the trunk of an adjacent blue gum, a Zen concession to the all-encompassing. A flat ceiling, white like the room\u2019s lengths of solid wall, gives this extension to the main house\u2019s living/dining space a subtle sense of exclusivity. You have arrived in the physically separate channel room, at the view, at the house\u2019s inner sanctum.</p><p>The east-facing major wing of the original house has been transformed by James\u2019 determination to enhance the spatial integrity of the interior architecture. Stripped of non-essential walls and built-in patina, the naked interior may have been in danger of becoming a cavernous antechamber to a view. In fact, the opposite effect has been achieved. Architectural possibilities have been realized despite the view.</p><p>Stained boarding lining the steep inner pitch of roofs has been retained, as have exposed and stained timber trusses. The original clinker brick walls have been hard-plastered and painted warm white. Internal space has thus been polarized \u2013 dark above the wall plate, light below except for the gable walls, which are also white. In the light zone are the superbly crafted and understated celery-top bookcases, benches and other built-ins, the furniture, the view.</p><p>Modest window openings have been converted into extensive glazed segments, openable and site-embracing. It is when the large, beautifully made, double-glazed, timber-framed sliding doors are open that the building is best able to concede its debt to an extraordinary location.</p><p>By introducing light and dark spatial zoning, the interior volume of the major wing (living/dining areas, kitchen and master bedroom) is both unified and humanized. In-slab heating generates a comfortable ambient warmth, which is boosted by heat from a polished limestone, sheathed-glass wood stove centrally located. &#160;Cross-ventilation is achieved by opening full-height vertical grille slots integrated into the sliding door frame system. Grey quarry tiles line floors throughout the building. Restrained elegance is everywhere manifest, often expressed in sparse touches of human occupation (woodblock prints, ceramics, weeping courtyard trees) for a Japanese feel.</p><p>A secondary wing with loft extends back at right angles from the point of entry. A verandah running along the north and west faces of the original house has been enclosed using the openable glazing system. The resulting corridor room, flat ceilinged and quarry tiled, overlooks a delightful white pebbled courtyard and provides access to a laundry, two bedrooms (one in the loft), a guest WC and the link to a new garage sited to the wing\u2019s south. On the west face the corridor room becomes an enclosed extension of the courtyard.</p><p>Trial Bay House embraces the visual appeal of a magnificent site while asserting a respectful presence in its privileged location. This reinterpreted residence achieves architectural integrity externally by announcing itself as a confident and dignified human-made component in the landscape. Internally it is superbly detailed, beautifully crafted and spatially exciting. An acceptable level of environmental performance has been achieved without remote control. The finished project is emphatic in its assertion, \u201cmoney well spent.\u201d</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>An intricate patterned pergola cleverly adapts a Queensland outdoor living concept to the Melbourne climate.</strong></p><p>When Fiona Dunin of FMD Architects designed the extension to her brother\u2019s house in Brunswick, in order to achieve all that he wanted and keep the construction under budget, they came up with an ingenious plan. Rather than reduce the scope of the works, they divided the job into two parts. They would leave the aesthetic centrepiece \u2013 the pergola \u2013 till later and get a professional builder to do only the simple box-like extension. The pergola they would build themselves! \u201cA builder would look at the drawings and think&#160;it was really complicated,\u201d says Fiona, and \u201ccomplicated\u201d equates to \u201cexpensive.\u201d So, with her brother acting as the owner-builder, and Fiona\u2019s husband working as the carpenter, the extended family chipped in together to finish the job.</p><p>\u201cThe pergola is the piece that connects the inside to the outside,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cThey live outside a lot.\u201d Her brother\u2019s in-laws live in Queensland and they visit there regularly and enjoy the outdoor lifestyle. The pergola, with its open trellis walls to allow cross-breezes, would sit comfortably in a subtropical context. The design cleverly adapts a Queensland living concept to Melbourne weather conditions. Instead of creating a cool, shadowy space, the roof is clad in translucent sheeting, with the geometric trelliswork acting as an additional filter to the light. A portable gas heater provides winter warmth for cooking and entertaining outdoors, and the sealed roof traps warm air.</p><p>Stage one involved the builder knocking down the old lean-to out the back and building two new bathrooms and a north-facing, open-plan kitchen-living-dining room. An open slot in the pergola roof allows winter sun and year-round morning sun to enter the kitchen space. \u201cThey both get up early, so light was important,\u201d says Fiona. The slot also acts as a marker for the informal entry to the house. \u201cNo-one uses the front door; all their friends come up the side,\u201d she explains, and this is how we approach, two dogs barking and licking at us enthusiastically. Walking down the side of the house is where you first encounter the aesthetic device that elevates this project above a standard builder\u2019s extension. &#160;The offcuts from the laser-cut plywood trelliswork are stuck to the wall in an asymmetrical composition that increases in density as you approach the pergola. Fiona calls it \u201cembossing.\u201d</p><p>The pattern itself was inspired by the idea of a French stocking being pulled over a leg and the way it expands into a diamond grid. Fiona describes it as one of \u201cmany pattern templates that we adapt to each project to create a tailored response.\u201d On another project they might manipulate the density and openness to control sight-lines for town planning regulations. This time the pattern is made denser to hide downpipes and the box-gutter on the roof, and opens up to let in light and breezes. The truly miraculous aspect to this simple technique is the degree to which it works as camouflage for the crude structure that supports it. If you look carefully you can see the cheap, standard timber studs and noggings, the metal cross-bracing and the roof beams, all painted the same green-grey, yet the whole effect is of beautiful visual complexity. The translucent roof sheets give a soft ambient glow. In the evening concealed lighting creates a diffused effect, without casting shadows, subtly transforming the pergola\u2019s appearance.</p><p>The laser-cut panels were the last things to be installed. After a quick measure up of the naked structure, the CAD files were emailed to the laser cutter with a request to keep the offcuts. The extended family came to paint them, which was a big job. \u201cEven my five-year-old daughter helped out,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cThe whole \u2018owner-builder\u2019 thing is a lot harder. I think everyone who tries it learns to appreciate builders more and the costs involved. But it worked out pretty well.\u201d The doghouse will be the next stage of the project \u2013 it too will receive diamond-pattern offcuts and a matching paint job. Even the landscaping contractor has been inspired. The last stage of works will extend the pattern into the garden.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A grand old Edwardian in Melbourne\u2019s suburbs has been respectfully renovated and extended, each room given a distinctly different scale and character.</strong></p><p>Is there any ground more wedded to the idea of the suburb than the hallowed terrain of Melbourne\u2019s Grace Park Estate in Hawthorn? Here the decorative effects of \u201cblood and bandage\u201d brickwork, lacework verandah trims and terracotta tiled roofs have been nurtured for a hundred years. The idea of house as a perfectible, controllable universe is palpably present. But look a little closer and here and there you see evidence that the way we live now is transforming these nineteenth-century ideals. The architects describe a planning regime that \u2013 quite properly \u2013 seeks to preserve the illusion of a suburb in aspic, while clients seek spatial extensions that defy the old divisions between inside and outside. Australian houses are now routinely the largest in the world, preparing for climate change by incorporating within their shells almost everything that was once in the gardens, from the drying of washing to the riding of tricycles.</p><p>What has happened here? The original house has a corner lot configuration: an L of garden surrounds a central gabled entry porch flanked by gabled bays. The landscape architect (chosen because of his Lilliputian work on the Ian Potter Foundation Children\u2019s Garden at the Botanic Gardens) has evened up the two arms, fencing off a Leunig-like play garden at one end, and has located a turning circle on the diagonal of the block. Two small islands of grass surmounted by bottle trees flank the entry porch, looking for all the world like a pair of spectacles. And indeed, on entering the house, there has been much Alice in Wonderland scale shifting. Grand though the existing spaces were, they were connected by mean standard doors. The openings have been hugely enlarged and extended so that once inside you feel suddenly much smaller, as if you have popped through the front door into a TARDIS. Working back from sight lines that preserve the illusion of Edwardian splendour outside and in, the architects have then carved out oodles of space. During design they thought of this as \u201cstealth\u201d operation. The form \u2013 in abstract terms \u2013 streaks away back from the front like a stealth bomber. It is sheathed in copper, startling at first but already in a warm partnership with the existing brickwork. A double-height library is incised between the front rooms and an existing music room at the rear. Through this descends a staircase that seems to hang from the new space upstairs, as if let down as undercarriage to the \u201cbomber\u201d that has settled above. This effect is achieved by locating trusses in the walls of the library void and having them carry the hidden beam from which the stair hangs. Upstairs there are bedrooms, walk-through bathrooms, walk-in cupboards and a long laundry. The plan is cleft: a roof light to the new centre of the house defines the base of the cleavage. Between the two wings \u2013 one for parents, the other for children \u2013 is a deck overlooking the swimming pool. On this deck a large deciduous tree in a pot will cast its shade.</p><p>Let\u2019s go back to the entry. At your left, through the palatial new doorway, is a study with a concealed cellar and operations room. Ahead of you the old reception rooms are linked by wide openings. As Louis Kahn might have put it, these rooms are at last what they always wanted to be. The hall leads you past the library incision, towards what at first sight seems to be a wide outside plane. A curving timber wall eases you from the hall into a space that again makes you feel that you have had a nibble at one of those mushrooms that had such dramatic effects on Alice. This is not really a room at all, but a very deep verandah, where \u2013 as in some tropical houses \u2013 regardless of the formal naming of the enclosed rooms of the house, everyone lives. Certainly it is glazed in, but at a touch of a button blinds glide up; with a little effort the glazing opens and there is a continuous flow to the lawn and pool beyond. <br />Floating magically on this neutral plane is a cloud-like object, around one lobe of which six children can sit to do their homework. In another lobe is a sink and at the further end a meal can be prepared within easy reach of the capacious pantry lurking behind the curving timber wall. A jumping castle of beanbags faces a TV, inviting release when homework is done. Beyond is the quiet dignity of the music room held down by a grand piano.</p><p>At the rear is a small circular lawn arranged in rings like a target. From here you take the money shot of the house. A place to stand, G&amp;T in hand, and think, \u201cYes! This is our idea of a house.\u201d</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A glazed pavilion overlooking the Tasman Sea is pared back to its essence, making for a perfect holiday house.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for a seaside town in the off-season. There&rsquo;s something about the low skies and grey seas, the cold and empty streets, the shuttered windows. Approaching this Merimbula beach house by car, we&rsquo;re greeted by a &ldquo;boarded-up&rdquo; facade of grey timber &hellip; an archetypal off-season moment. This rectangular form is the lower floor of the house, half buried in the sloping site. Above is a glazed pavilion, but with its generous setbacks and grass-fringed decks this element is barely visible and we are introduced to the house as a closed timber box.</p>\r\n<p>On closer inspection it is evident how active this timber box is. The skin of horizontal blackbutt boards folds back to reveal the windows to three bedrooms across the frontage and forms a pair of hinged doors that open onto the compact garage, responding to the activity within the house. But this is winter, the house is closed and the artful grey of the timber facade recedes into the earth and blends with the weathered timber and grasses of the garden.</p>\r\n<p>From the street there are two access paths to the building. On the left is the steep and narrow driveway that leads directly into the garage, housed within the lower level of the house. On the right a stepped pedestrian path accesses the front door on the upper level. These dual points of entry denote different ways of engaging with the house and demonstrate the functional divide between the upper and lower levels. On the one hand, the publicly accessible pedestrian path skims past the lower level to the living, dining and kitchen pavilion, which opens onto panoramic views of ocean, displayed like a spectacular artwork through full-height windows. But we experience the other entry, through the garage, which provides direct and intimate access to the private spaces of the bedrooms and bathrooms, and passes (conveniently, after an eight-hour drive with two small children) the laundry. Complementing the approach into the house through the front door, this entry strikes you as entirely suitable for the dumping, disrobing and shedding that follow a trip to the beach.</p>\r\n<p>The north and south elevations of the upper level are frameless glass, without mullions or openings to interrupt the panorama. The glazing returns around the room&rsquo;s corners to maximize the solar access of the northern aspect and the views over the Tasman Sea to the south. The expansive view is compelling, filling the room, day and night. But the upper level is not a pure modernist glass pavilion. The glazed ends are offset by solid timber walls to the east and west, which embrace the internal stair and open onto the generous deck that rims the upper level to the west and south. These walls are lined internally and externally with blackbutt, the weathered external faces recalling countless humbler beach houses.</p>\r\n<p>Not that there isn&rsquo;t an engaging modesty to this house. Huw Turner from Collins and Turner explains that the client decided early on in the design process that the house would be commercially rented, as well as acting as a family holiday home, and while this variation of brief didn&rsquo;t affect the compact planning of the house, it did influence the spare choice of materials that comprise the exterior and interior palettes.</p>\r\n<p>Huw describes the robust material aesthetic of the building by comparing it to an access path to the beach, an appropriate metaphor for a house that provides the critical link between the urban world and the natural environment for its holidaying occupants. Bleached or weathered timber, concrete and neutral colours predominate. Sealed concrete floors are used throughout the entire house (warmed in the winter by in-slab heating). The ceilings of the lower floor are the painted soffits of the slab above, sliced through with slots that conceal simple fluorescent battens. Brick walls in the bedrooms are painted white and paired with solid and simple blackbutt joinery. Painted brick extends into the surprisingly large main bathroom, which is made more generous by a mirrored end wall. In the bedrooms a couple of hooks suffice for hanging space. Everything about the house, both spatially and materially, has been pared back to its most basic essence.<img class=\"img_right\" src=\"/site_media/media/files/images/merimbulahouse_simonwh_opt.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></p>\r\n<p>This sparse palette and its disposition is a reminder that this is a holiday house. The materials are not Spartan, but nor are they familiarly domestic. Other moments reinforce this sense of being removed from the quotidian, even in the off-season. The kitchen has been deliberately designed without a single full-height cupboard, allowing the view to dominate the space. Bar fridges might not work for a family home but when you&rsquo;re on holiday, bending to reach the milk bottle is a play-off you&rsquo;re willing to make in order to have the uninterrupted view. Conscious design decisions such as these pervade the house, creating its air of considered informality. And who needs more than a hook for their clothes when you&rsquo;re on a beach holiday &hellip; in winter?</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A historic stone barn has been sensitively brought back to life as a one-bedroom dwelling in the old farming district of West Hobart.</strong></p><p>Peppered within large suburban blocks lining the hills of Hobart are grand homes, often barely visible at the end of long lanes. These homes reflect Hobart in the opening decades of the colony, when farmers and wealthier colonials built residences away from the dirt and smell of the settlement. Such historic remnants are relatively easy to find and heritage laws now protect them. Harder to discover are the more lowly outbuildings, particularly if they have lost the home to which they belonged. Tucked away behind a Federation terrace, this stone barn is one such building that has been sensitively brought back to life with a refurbishment by Maria Gigney Architects.</p><p>Leaving one builder speechless and making another swear violently, the barn presented to Maria was literally falling apart. Rising damp, rapidly deteriorating stonework, an earthen floor, every wall out of square and a noticeable lack of footings were features that might well make a builder swear. On the other hand, the little barn excited the heritage experts, as there is a reasonable chance that it is one of the earliest stone structures remaining from the days when West Hobart was a farming district. While it is currently unlisted, all parties involved were keen to retain the best qualities of this heritage building.</p><p>Not only did Maria happily take on this tricky project, she also cannily uncovered the potential to stratum title the property, significantly increasing the value of the rear section of the site containing the barn. This move increased the value of the renovation and made it into the project it has become. She also coerced the right kind of builder to patiently love the building back into shape.</p><p>Working predominantly within the existing six-by-four-metre internal footprint of the building, Maria and the builder have crafted a one-bedroom dwelling over two floors, solving a series of problems along the way. The first issue was the earthen floor and rising damp. The solution was to cap the damp at the base with one hidden slab and one polished slab and detail throughout to set any new work away from the walls, allowing the masonry to breathe. The next and rather substantial obstacle was an inability to insulate the stone and brick walls present on three sides of the building without lining the interior and hiding the texture of these materials. Similarly, Maria did not want to conceal the existing aged roofing timbers. The resolution was to build a steel frame within the masonry walls that supports a new floor and heavily insulated roof. The new roof sits over the old as if part of the original structure, without applying any structural load to the aged rafters. In addition, all openings were double-glazed.</p><p>With the main problems solved, the remainder was all about designing for a clever fit into the small space, imbuing every decision with the desire to retain the original qualities of the building. To provide a little extra breathing space, Maria has stretched the building on the approach side to make a sky-lit entry. Lined internally and externally with vertical timber, this elevation pays homage to the original cladding. The very solid matching entry door disappears into the cladding with a soft click, transforming the alcove into usable space. The heated, polished slab of the entry extends to encompass the kitchen before giving way to a raised timber floor for the living space. Rising through the building is a joinery \u201ctower\u201d that provides storage on both levels and, most importantly, accommodates all of the services so that the walls can be left free of any form of conduit or pipe. The stairs spring from the living level, rising behind the service core with lush, solid timber treads. Other new finishes throughout are either timber or tile. A dark stain is generally used for horizontal surfaces, to match the original timberwork, while natural oak is reserved for floor planes.</p><p>Like any good piece of urban weaving, the success of this renovation is about knowing what to hold on to and what to let go. Luck would have it that all parties \u2013 client, architect, builder \u2013 were in agreement about the division between these aspects of the project, so that the end result feels contemporary while still exuding some of the character of a small outbuilding. Importantly, they all shared a desire to really engage with the process of recycling and reuse. Wherever possible, not only the shell but timbers and salvaged bricks have found their way back into ceilings, paving and furniture, such that little of the original building has actually left the site. Even items of glassware and crockery, found under the earth floor, have become a framed art piece for the living space. Herein lie the seeds of genuine sustainability.</p>",

Their latest product range is called Basics: a pendant lamp, a mirror, a shelf, a desk magnet and some paperweights. \u201cThe work doesn\u2019t need to have a story behind it to have its place,\u201d says Emma. However, the story behind Basics is their previous collection, Solids, and before Solids came Shapes, the collection they designed in London.</p><p>After graduating from industrial design in Adelaide in 2007, Daniel and Emma set off to London to work for Marc Newson, Thorsten van Elten and Committee. \u201cWe learnt a lot of really valuable lessons in the UK,\u201d says Emma. Each product in Shapes has a square, a circle, a triangle and a pentagon combined in different ways to produce four functional devices \u2013 a fan, a radio, a dinner set and a table. They exhibited Shapes in London and Japan. \u201cWe had an OK response, but we learnt a lot about the level of quality that work has to have, and how competitive the marketplace is,\u201d says Emma.</p><p>Returning to Adelaide, they received a grant from the South Australian Government to design a new collection, Solids. This time, all the products were designed to create a unified \u201cscene,\u201d as Daniel puts it. Exhibiting in London, \u201cwe were blown away by the reaction,\u201d says Emma. \u201cPeople started saying \u2018I want to stock that in my store,\u2019\u201d adds Daniel. \u201cIt got more real. We started it for fun, but now people wanted to invest money.\u201d Solids is now in the process of being manufactured in China, a somewhat frustrating procedure because of the lack of face-to-face contact. While waiting, they decided to design a range that could be manufactured in Australia \u2013 Basics. \u201cWe tried to reduce the amount of labour per object,\u201d explains Daniel, \u201cand in some ways this dictated the forms of the objects.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cledge\u201d is so called because it is made from two pieces of pine glued together and is only ninety millimetres wide. The cone-shaped lamp is turned from a solid pine block and it\u2019s a surprise to discover it is so hefty and thick. The brass weights are precision-cut from standard extrusions and are extraordinarily heavy, even surprising Daniel and Emma. Their first prototypes were about four times the size. \u201cThe rectangular prism was like a brick,\u201d says Emma. \u201cYou could have killed someone with it.\u201d The circular mirror has a bumpy aluminium surface, whose soft reflection reminds Daniel of early mirrors in Europe.</p><p>\u201cWe design around the way things look,\u201d says Daniel. \u201cWe just like very clean, simple things,\u201d adds Emma. They are enjoying the slower pace of Adelaide. It suits them. \u201cIt\u2019s not too fancy,\u201d drawls Daniel. \u201cNot too fancy,\u201d echoes Emma with a laugh.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>The honest, refined nature of this house at the headland of Port Phillip Bay responds to the owner&rsquo;s love for Scandinavian design.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The residents of this quiet, tree-lined road in one of Victoria&rsquo;s coastal communities have had their peaceful world turned upside down. Since the demolition of an old asbestos cottage on the southern side of the street and the erection of a new house in its place, there has been a marked increase in traffic. For the family concerned &ndash; a couple and their two young sons, who live here permanently &ndash; the stream of people driving past to gawp at their new house has become something of a joke. Luckily, an automated, battened driveway gate keeps the curious from wandering in to take a closer look, but it doesn&rsquo;t prevent them from craning their necks over the top to take snaps.</p>\r\n<p>All this attention is flattering, concedes the house&rsquo;s architect, Peter Woolard of Geelong-based practice Studio 101 Architects. &ldquo;But more importantly, half of those people might never have looked at architecture before,&rdquo; he says philosophically. &ldquo;So if this project means that they start looking at it, talking and thinking about it, then that&rsquo;s a great thing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The north-facing house is the boldest architectural expression in the street to date. It is also one of the few eye-catching contemporary houses in the small beachside town at the headland of Port Phillip Bay, so no wonder it is drawing crowds. It stands on a large, rectangular block of almost 900 square metres that slopes down from the southern rear boundary to the street frontage. The architects took advantage of the sloping site, slotting the rear end of the single-storey house into the hillside, close to the back fence. This created room for a double-car garage and a studio to be tucked underneath, separated from each other by the centrally positioned entry.</p>\r\n<p>From the street the house&rsquo;s elevation is imposing. The main living area cantilevers out over the recessed garage, cocked on a slight angle to face due north and frame views into the canopies of large, old eucalypts fringing the block.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If we had put a deck on the front, there would have been issues of privacy,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;Plus decks tend to be cluttered with outdoor furniture so that you lose the sense of floating and elevation when looking out from the house.&rdquo; Instead, he put the deck between the primary living space (a combined kitchen, dining and living area) and the rumpus room at the rear. Wedged between the two, the central deck provides a sheltered, sunny outdoor area that acts essentially as an internal courtyard and third living space. This arrangement also maximizes winter sun penetration into both living rooms and facilitates easy cross-ventilation. &ldquo;It allows the house to breathe,&rdquo; says Peter.</p>\r\n<p>Running through the house and the courtyard deck is a spine wall of blond concrete block that fulfils a number of functions. As well as providing thermal mass, it clearly separates the western living side of the house from the central corridor and the private sleeping and bathing wing that runs parallel to it, to the east. Starting outside as a two-storey element, the block wall borders one side of the primary living area, where it contains a fireplace as well as niches for built-in furniture. A bank of full-height joinery along the opposite side of the room houses food preparation areas and extra storage. When all the cupboard doors are closed, the kitchen virtually disappears.</p>\r\n<p>Continuing through the courtyard, the block wall incorporates an outdoor fireplace and a barbecue before it ends in the rear rumpus room, where again it contains a niche for a built-in entertainment unit. The various fireplaces and niches emphasize the wall&rsquo;s depth and solidity, as does the opening from the corridor into the front living area. When crossing this threshold, the robust essence of the house is clearly apparent.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m influenced by mid-century modernism adapted to meet today&rsquo;s needs,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;An expression of simple forms and a limited palette of natural materials used in a careful, considered way are the style&rsquo;s key features, with materials left to age and patina over time. I hope this house doesn&rsquo;t always look so new, but weathers gracefully.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The honest, pared-back nature of the house is also due to the owners&rsquo; love for the clean lines of Scandinavian design. They are gradually filling the house with carefully selected pieces that underline the building&rsquo;s quiet strength.</p>\r\n<p>The brief &ndash; more functional than aesthetic &ndash; was for a relaxed family beachside home that wasn&rsquo;t overly large or showy, with plenty of storage and two living areas. The result is much more than the sum of those words. It is a warm, inviting space, filled with sunshine and buzzing with the energy of the young family who live there.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Smart spatial arrangements&#160;deliver maximum space for these adjoining terrace houses on a tight site in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs.</strong></p><p>Of all Sydney\u2019s chic eastern suburbs, Woollahra is the prime cafe catchment for young parents and empty nesters who love their latte lifestyles. The social scene befits a suburb whose Aboriginal name roughly translates to \u201cmeeting ground\u201d or \u201ca sitting down place.\u201d Homes here are tightly held and ritualistically improved to maximize returns.</p><p>The site is in a narrow throughway off bustling Queen Street. The character of the area is set in the heritage values of tiny workers\u2019 cottages, slim terrace rows and occasional stately homes. The single-storey red clinker brick suburban house that formerly occupied the site would certainly have looked incongruous in this setting.</p><p>When planning to develop the site, the owner took the opportunity to subdivide the 294-square-metre block to create two adjoining terraces. Architect Andrew Stanic took on the project once the council approved the original development plans and the existing dwelling had been razed. With a blank slate, Stanic Harding\u2019s brief was to stay close to the approved skin and consider the streetscape and heritage value of the area.</p><p>Not convinced that the initial drawings would deliver the best results, Stanic Harding reworked the pre-approved plans to maximize livable spaces and improve environmental performance. Their approach takes the terrace typology into modernist territory, creating two highly accommodating four-level homes with clean lines. Both are characterized by openness, natural light and thoughtful orchestration.</p><p>Viewed from the street, the new insertions blend in with their historic counterparts with minimal fuss. Conservative balconied facades swap traditional lace trimmings for timber panel lining and stainless steel balustrades that hint at the quality of finishes within.</p><p>A logical organization strategy was employed to expand the dwelling over four levels with a coveted car space on site. From the street, the entrance doubles as a reading room or informal bar area that segues down into a large open-plan living, dining and kitchen area. This split-level approach uses the natural fall of the land to provide an almost double-height volume oriented westward. Sunshading is afforded by the balcony overhang from the second storey. A bank of glazed doors offers indoor\u2013outdoor convenience to directly access a generous pocket of lawn.</p><p>Environmental considerations are addressed at every level. Downstairs the monolithic concrete slab provides a valuable thermal mass. Upstairs, all windows, internal doors and access ways are exaggerated to heighten the sense of openness. Aluminium louvres on east- and west-facing window walls of the upstairs bedrooms and studio allow full control of natural light and cross-breezes. Fluorescent uplighting was chosen for its soft wash effect and energy-efficiency. A roof garden mass planted with silver-blue succulents adds insulation weight to the master bedroom below. Run-off from the roof spaces is collected into a large volume tank concealed in the garden and used in toilets and to water the garden.</p><p>As with many Stanic Harding projects, internal custom joinery provides interest and texture as well as vast storage in keeping with minimalist principles. Andrew has a preference for blond woods like sycamore, which is used in panelling to conceal laundry facilities. The white gloss \u201ctower of power\u201d hides all stereo and entertainment gadgetry. A high slot in bright apple green provides a colour point in an otherwise neutral palette of materials and tones. This fresh slice projects from the powder room, giving the occupant a glimpse of garden greenery while retaining privacy.</p><p>The circulation spine of the staircase defines exactly how spaces are arranged throughout. Slatted blackbutt flooring at each landing point allows occupants to see all the way up and down the stairwell and to read the full height of the structure. Floating stair treads contribute to a sense of airiness. This device successfully draws light and air throughout. It also sets up some interesting acoustics. \u201cNoise travels subtly and interestingly from one level to another. In a space that essentially is a box with a lid on it, you can hear snippets of conversations from adjoining spaces downstairs,\u201d explains Andrew Stanic. \u201cIt means people feel connected without being on top of one another.\u201d</p><p>Spaces become more intimate as they ascend. Two bedrooms, a large bathroom and a master bedroom are all generously proportioned on the second floor. The top level is a multifunction space that could become a study, upper entertainment room or fourth bedroom. The cosiness of this room is offset by natural light from side windows and the glazed wall to the sun-drenched terrace.</p><p>Within the confines of a single block, Stanic Harding demonstrates that generous volumes and exceptional family accommodation can be achieved through smart spatial arrangements. Their contemporary approach alleviates the darkness and hemmed-in feeling of the standard terrace house form. In doing so they lighten and loosen the tensions of inner-city living, making family homes that are both easy to enjoy and easy on the environment.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Perched on the side of a ridge facing east, this house takes maximum advantage of the breathtaking views that the picturesque Sunshine Coast hinterland has to offer.</strong></p><p>It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, I know, but \u201cGod\u2019s own country\u201d is one of those phrases that just pops into mind unsolicited when you reach the high ridge inhabited by the township of Maleny. Emerald green cow pastures, gently rolling hills, babbling brooks and remnant rainforest are only the beginning. Winding around the ridge and through the picturesque little town in the Sunshine Coast hinterland brings you to the vantage point of \u2013 arguably \u2013 one of our country\u2019s most spectacular views. An ancient volcanic plain below is punctured by the pinnacle-like cores of the Glass House Mountains \u2013 strange, jagged, anthropomorphic forms, frozen in poses of hunching, weeping and preening. Beyond is the Pacific Ocean, with Moreton Island\u2019s white sandhills emblazoned on its western side. On a clear day even Brisbane\u2019s skyline, ninety kilometres south, is on display.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Maleny has long been a favourite home away from home for retirees and tree changers, who are happy to share it with the old-timer farmers and the hippy contingent alike. (The Woodford Folk Festival had its genesis here, until space and infrastructure could no longer cope.) When Dan Sparks\u2019 parents found a spot on the mountain from which to enjoy their semi-retirement years, they commissioned their son to renovate and extend the existing home.</p><p>\u201cIt began life as a fairly ordinary blockwork building,\u201d recalls Dan. \u201cWhen Mum and Dad bought it, it had been used as a bed and breakfast \u2013 a kind of \u2018romantic weekend getaway\u2019 place.\u201d</p><p>Perched on the side of the ridge facing east, the house has a view both panoramic and breathtaking. A few cows are mooing just over the fence and chooks are happily ranging free in the orchard. The agricultural setting provided an impetus for the home\u2019s aesthetic, which, as Dan puts it, is \u201cboth modern and appropriate to the rural character of the area.\u201d</p><p>Another impetus came from Dan\u2019s memories of his family home in Brisbane. His parents currently boast six grandchildren. With the number likely to increase, the home was also designed to easily accommodate sleepovers, playtimes and large family gatherings. At least one Christmas Day and a baby\u2019s christening have already tested the facilities. Overseas and interstate relatives are also catered for, and many visiting \u201clunch\u201d friends on the weekends. The earlier home is deliberately invoked in the tongue-and-groove boards, the water features and colour schemes. These elements are reminders for the middle and older generations and create a continuing, shared connection for coming generations. Accommodating the owners\u2019 old furniture instead of \u201cstarting over\u201d fitted with the sentiment.</p><p>The orientation of the new work was dictated by the original building, which now forms the central section of three wings. Internal walls were removed and a wall of glazing placed along the east, capturing the long view. The old deck was revamped into a series of platforms, some exposed and some roofed, that step out from the main living room. A new pavilion, housing a master bedroom, library, robe and bathroom, flanks the living room and deck on the south. To the north, an old carport has been converted into office-cum-breakout space and connected to the original house via a corridor of bedrooms and hallway bunks.</p><p>The new bedroom pavilion juts eastward, protecting the original home and outdoor areas from the sometimes vicious south-easterlies. Its elegant butterfly roof lifts to catch the sun, which can penetrate deep into the spaces during winter. A band of clerestory glazing runs around the top of the pavilion walls, working not only as a sun trap but also as a window for moon and star gazing. An outdoor bathtub, a remnant of the former b. &amp; b. days, has been retained and set into a timber deck. In a further incantation of the pavilion as a discrete space, ponds divide it from the deck. Access is gained carefully, over stepping stones.</p><p>The new pavilion\u2019s slim elegance belies the rustic nature of its materials. Recycled hardwood from old telephone poles is used extensively in the exposed structure. Floors are polished concrete and walls clad in clear finished ply. This ruggedness reaches its crescendo in the kitchen fitout, where a gnarly slab of local red gum serves as a preparation bench, and the wet bench is another thick slab of concrete. Zincalume wall cladding, raw galvanized structural frames and a \u201cmud room\u201d for boots near the carport entry maintain the rural idyll, but are also driven by pragmatics.</p><p>A sophisticated program of sustainability encompasses massive water storage tanks. Herb and vegetable gardens benefit from the water, but there\u2019s fun and games too with an existing tank lid set into the garden and doubling as a giant chessboard. Further along the terrace, an adjustable day bed sits in wait for siesta.</p>",

Having admired a similar project by Crawford in a magazine, they bought a comparable property, engaged the architect and continued to live in Hong Kong for much of the renovation, returning near its completion.</p><p>The light-filled, 162-square-metre house started out as a modest two-bedroom brick and tile inter-war bungalow. Though the majority of the original house was structurally sound, it was awkwardly configured. A large dining room on the north side of the house made the adjacent living space dark and uninviting.</p><p>The updated street facade is characterized by new overlaying old, creating a sense of arrival that was previously lacking. A new steel-framed entry porte-cochere (with parking for one) and a screened entrance deck to the left give the home a contemporary identity, offering much greater interaction with the streetscape, despite the irony that council approval proved difficult.</p><p>A new translucent glass front door allows light to flood into a new central hallway. Located where part of the old enclosed verandah and dining room once sat, this new circulation axis highlights visual connection between key axes through the house. To the right there is a study and master bedroom suite, while to the left are two bedrooms for the couple\u2019s young daughters, a previously renovated bathroom beyond, and a generous linen cupboard slotted in where a narrow hallway once stood. A new skylight also brings an abundance of natural light into the heart of the house.</p><p>Replacing a rear asbestos lean-to kitchen and laundry structure, a new steel-framed, double-height living space is seamlessly attached to the original house. Stepping from the bedroom zone into the airy, pavilion-like space, the dining area takes centre stage, with living zone beyond and a streamlined kitchen with lineal island bench to the left. Tucked away behind the kitchen is a generously proportioned separate laundry.</p><p>The rear boundary was previously dominated by an overbearing neighbouring property, so the architects worked extensively with 3D models and section drawings to resolve sightlines in the new addition. Crawford explains that the solution called for a composition of solid and void, with \u201chigh-level louvred glass windows to the north and south, which allow in light and sun while maintaining privacy, balanced by high-level timber louvred windows to the east and west, which allow natural ventilation without the hot morning and afternoon sun.\u201d</p><p>With its soaring ceilings, the rear living pavilion now feels like an extension of the outdoor zone. Flowing through bifold glass doors to the outdoor living areas, the addition includes a plunge pool in the north-west corner of the garden.</p><p>Providing much needed shade, a timber pergola runs the length of the western facade. A row of Viburnum shrubs along the rear boundary will provide further shading and screening as they mature. The covered outdoor barbecue area expands the living space and a wraparound concrete built-in bench, which extends underneath the pergola, provides plenty of flexibility for larger groups.</p><p>Externally, materials are rich and warm, with black-painted steel and western red cedar on the new rear pavilion, pergola and front entry. The living pavilion cleverly integrates a reverse-brick-veneer construction, with ochre-stained plywood cladding on the rear elevation and off-white rendered lightweight cladding on the side boundaries. The black steel theme continues with new external security panels provided for the bedrooms.</p><p>Internally, a muted palette of white tones was chosen to expand the sense of space. In the kitchen, stainless steel appliances contrast with glossy white cabinetry, and a sleek white joinery element showcasing treasured family snaps and belongings was custom-made for the entire rear wall of the living space. These pale tones contrast richly with dark-stained recycled blackbutt floors, with stone-toned woollen carpet in the bedrooms.</p><p>The extension maximizes energy-efficiency in a number of ways. There is plenty of thermal mass in the insulated cavity wall construction, while a concrete slab beneath the timber floor and substantial glazing to the north ensure optimal thermal performance. Ceiling fans, effective cross-ventilation and external sunshading to the east and west keep the interiors cool in summer without the need for airconditioning. Rainwater storage tanks were installed along the southern facade, with 5,000-litre capacity to service the house and garden.</p><p>Recycled materials were used where possible, including the blackbutt timber flooring, reused original floorboards, footings and much of the original timber underfloor structure. However, \u201cretaining the existing front portion of the house was the key sustainable measure,\u201d says project architect Karen Erdos. With a sensitive transformation, boxy, dark rooms are a thing of the past in this uplifting, elegant, yet practical family home.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>While the formal front rooms of this original 1902 home remain intact, the back is cleverly transformed into a leisure zone.</strong></p><p>The Australian dream of the quarter-acre block manifests in varying degrees of style and grandeur. When Brentford was built in 1902, it sat on 800 square metres in the (now) inner riverside suburb of Dutton Park in Brisbane. Backyards then were typically sprawling, semi-agrarian plots. Obligatory mango and pawpaw trees marked the edges, chook sheds promoted expedient use of ripple iron and DIY construction, water tanks spawned mint and weeds below, and clothes props spanned vegetable patches. All was overseen by a lonely outhouse standing at a discreet distance from the main home, connected by a beeline strip of concrete or beaten earth. Cricket games were largely street affairs and formal flower beds relegated to the more picturesque front gardens.</p><p>Brentford maintains a dignified, traditional appearance to the street, with a sense of grandeur in the generous front gardens and wide stair leading to its shady verandah. The composed front garden and entry zone are plausibly considered the home\u2019s \u201canteroom\u201d and make arrival a pleasurable, choreographed experience. The back of the house was a different story.</p><p>Owners Peter Clarke and Lindy Johnson became the fourth generation of Peter\u2019s family to occupy Brentford when Peter bought the property sixteen years ago \u2013 forming part of a continuous single family occupation that dates to 1917. When family needs dictated more modern accoutrements than the Edwardian house provided, the couple commissioned David Gole of Riddel Architecture to convert the rear of the house to open, connected spaces that relate to the outdoors. This included a kitchen renewal. (Lindy recalls that the dark, truncated kitchen suspended from the back and disconnected from the yard below was cause for tears as she and Peter attempted to cook on an aged fireplace stove that deposited soot into the food.) The home\u2019s undercroft, partly subterranean and secreted by timber battens, was also modified to accommodate children\u2019s bedrooms and a laundry. It is playfully connected to the upper floor by a steep timber ladder entered through a hatch-like space in the living room floor. Any vestiges of pragmatic backyard typology were severed when 200 square metres of the block was sliced off to accommodate a separate allotment and detached infill house. In its stead is a compact leisure zone with a lap pool, planted borders and deck.</p><p>Formal front-of-house rooms remain intact. The living room is resplendent with a cornice of stencilled foliage, while original pine floorboards were denuded of their carpets and polished. A side verandah was transformed into an ensuite bathroom that is paradoxically spartan in its sense of luxury. David\u2019s carefully conceived plan was to preserve a judicious level of detail in the original home and pick up on its threads in the new light-filled spaces at the rear. A milky green colours the walls of the new back rooms, responding to the darker traditional green inside. Plywood panelling and cedar and pine sliding doors in the new zone connect with the palette of the original pine floor and wall boards and thick cedar skirtings and doors.</p><p>The poolside rooms flip the tall elegance of the original home\u2019s proportions to establish generous, languid, horizontal spaces reminiscent of verandahs. A large central section of glazing opens to merge the room with the deck. Glass louvres surround a corner window seat, also reminiscent of pragmatic verandah enclosures. The kitchen operates from its original spot in the opposite corner, divided from the adjacent dining zone and deck by high benches lined with bar stools.</p><p>A fourteen-metre lap pool forms the new boundary to the deck, providing a mesmerizing illuminated strip at night and built-in cooling in summer. Visual and aural privacy from the close neighbouring house is established through a solid boundary wall rising from the pool and housing a water blade for \u201cwhite noise.\u201d A rigging of steel struts and translucent fibreglass wraps up and over the pool from the wall and connects to the home\u2019s eaves as a sunscreen device. The unpainted galvanized structure is honest and cost-effective, according to David, who was interested in promoting a material honesty throughout the home\u2019s refurbishment. His philosophy of utilizing all the spaces both outside and in has been the happy consequence of a relatively humble budget.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Unexpected contrasts in form and scale take full advantage of the site geometries in a conservative street in suburban Sydney.</strong></p><p>At the risk of sounding clich\u00e9d, opposites do attract. Not always in love, but often in design, and in the case of this Sydney house, much of its appeal comes from its unexpected contrasts in form and scale. They begin with its relationship to place: a contemporary building on a conservative suburban street where buildings are mostly from the inter-war years. It\u2019s slightly out of context, though it takes all its cues \u2013 bar aesthetics \u2013 from the site.</p><p>\u201cThe form and everything that flows from it is a response to the awkward geometry of the block,\u201d says architect Andrew Burges. \u201cIt\u2019s a flat-ended wedge, with four neighbouring properties and a laneway adjoining, and there was a fairly ordinary Federation house in the centre of the site. Our strategy with the new house was to invert the site and compress the building to the back, where the geometry is tighter, to turn what traditionally is the front garden into an informal backyard. This is where the northern sun is, and we wanted to give the widest point of the site to the garden, not the house.\u201d</p><p>The laneway allowed Andrew to push parking to the back of the site and the building envelope right to the rear, leaving him the question: How should this building address the street?</p><p>\u201cWe started thinking about the suburban fence line as a critical datum in the experience of the house,\u201d say Andrew. \u201cBelow the fence line, it doesn\u2019t have much outlook, except for the garden, but it\u2019s more private. Above the fence line it opens up to broader views but it\u2019s more exposed, so there are privacy issues, which affected the language of this part of the structure. So we considered the floor plates for the two levels as quite separate and distinct, with different criteria shaping them.\u201d</p><p>From outside the shift is signalled not only in form, but also in material language. The ground floor is Bowral Blue face brick with cedar-framed glazing \u2013 a reference to the prior house. The first floor is positioned slightly off-axis from the level below, creating angled overhangs above the living spaces. In contrast to the ground floor\u2019s transparency, the first floor is fully screened with sliding cedar louvres.</p><p>Inside, the ground floor frames domestic life on a deep plan as opposed to the prevailing Australian linear model. \u201cWe were interested in the social functions of a house with unusual groupings of rooms, so we developed a deep rectangular plan of bays, separated by strong bands of walls, but open enough to allow access and viewing between the spaces.\u201d</p><p>The idea for the bays has a cultural note. \u201cOne of the clients is Indian and we looked at Le Corbusier\u2019s work in India \u2013 that repetitive bay format and thickness of walls. That idea certainly influenced our structure, though we\u2019ve organized it differently.\u201d The first bay is a dining room and informal living area with a window opening fully to the garden. This is a beautiful room for reading, catching the winter sun as it does.</p><p>The second bay is a busier space, with kitchen and butler\u2019s pantry to the south and family room to the north. Here a glass wall slides completely away, directly connecting this room to the garden. The third and smallest bay is a kids\u2019 play area overlooking a narrow lap pool.</p><p>Floors on this level are either recycled ironbark or polished concrete with a wet-look sealant. Walls partitioning the bays are thickened with joinery in American walnut. The kitchen is stainless steel and stone, with a high-mirrored splashback reflecting the garden. The palette is simple but detailed with hutches and display niches for books and collected objects to personalize the rooms.</p><p>While the ground-floor plan is tightly structured and focused towards the garden, upstairs is a looser fit. Individual rooms shift alignment and shape to catch the light or views. A generous tapered landing off the stairs opens to the main bedroom occupying the east wing. Its ensuite is partitioned into bays (vanity/toilet/shower) \u2013 the architects\u2019 reference to the nearby coastal bays of Bronte, Clovelly and Coogee. The west wing is divided into children\u2019s bedrooms, a bathroom and study.</p><p>As different as the two levels are in plan, they intersect at one dramatic point in the house: a high, faceted void above the kitchen. \u201cResolving the geometry between the two levels gave us an opportunity to solve the light issue at the back of the ground-floor deep plan with this playful element,\u201d explains Andrew, who delights in making thresholds of spatial interest. The entry to the house, for instance, is a five-ways intersection with passage to the garage, guest bathroom, laundry, living areas and staircase. Utility rooms such as the guest bathroom, butler\u2019s pantry and small south courtyard \u2013 tucked into the leftover segments of the ground-floor envelope \u2013 illustrate his approach to planning and scale. \u201cPushing these little rooms into the fill areas at the back left the main rooms with solid rectilinear space. Some elements are quite compressed, such as the bathrooms, and others are much larger than you\u2019d anticipate for rooms of this scale \u2013 like the sliding glass windows and doors of the living areas. How we arrived at them is more intuitive than theoretical, but I really like those opposites.\u201d</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>This much-loved home in suburban Canberra, completed in 1965, is a fine example of the late Sydney regional style.</strong></p><p>Red Hill is one of Canberra\u2019s early \u201cdress circle\u201d suburbs and its Mugga Way is locally called the \u201cGolden Mile.\u201d When Mick and Barbara Cater purchased a 1,400-square-metre block of land near the end of Mugga Way in the mid 1960s, the view over Canberra was very different from today. Canberra\u2019s underlying governmental, civic and residential structure was by then well established, but its suburban areas were only beginning to experience the population increases and building density of future decades. The site looked out over a sparsely developed landscape toward Mount Ainslie and the airport. In the valley below Mugga Way, the sometimes flood-prone Molonglo River was being transformed into the sparkling artificial Lake Burley Griffin.</p><p>The Caters commissioned Russell Jack of John Allen and Russell C. Jack Architects to design a house that would take advantage of the sweeping view, offer privacy from the street and neighbours and provide accommodation for the young family and their guests. The brief required separate living and dining areas, four bedrooms, a guest room, kitchen, laundry, tool room, two bathrooms, parking and outdoor areas. Russell\u2019s fine drawings detail the project\u2019s development into a house as satisfying today as in 1965.</p><p>In contrast to the common practice of domestic display, the Cater house reveals little to the passer-by, presenting an almost reticent face to the street. The front door and carport are effectively screened from view, both entered at ninety degrees to the street. The white front walls of the house and carport are punctuated by a single slit window and an opening leading to the entry porch. Newspaper articles in 1965 described the house as \u201cmasked\u201d and \u201cintroverted\u201d under the heading \u201cAward-winning house wins medallion,\u201d a seemingly ambivalent reception for this clearly contemporary architecture.</p><p>The building hugs the ground, anchored by layered walls stepping down the slope away from Mugga Way under a single skillion roof. Mature eucalyptus trees and Australian native plants emphasize the planar structure of the house. The material palette is restrained, including load-bearing brick walls bagged and painted white inside and out, white painted plasterboard ceilings and oiled Queensland blackwood joinery, along with carpeted, brick and polished timber floors. The house is composed of a suite of three pavilions wrapped around inner walled courtyards on the western and eastern sides, opening at the back onto a generous veranda with sweeping views across Canberra.</p><p>Russell\u2019s spatial sequencing is carefully orchestrated, with clear separation of the internal public and private areas. To the left of a small, brick-floored entry foyer is the guest room, with the single front facade window and a bathroom. The corner on this level is filled by the main bedroom, which looks onto one of two inner courtyards, suggestive of the enclosed garden or nakaniwa of Kyoto town houses. On the right side of the entry a short stair leads down to the centre of the house. At its base is a cosy, carpeted sitting room with a fireplace. On one side three vertical slot windows look back into the courtyard shared with the main bedroom, and on the other full-length sliding glass and dark wood doors open onto the timber deck and northerly views.</p><p>To the right of the stairs, the brick floor continues into a beautifully proportioned dining room, with a large wood and glass sliding door opening to the second internal courtyard. From a long dining table set under a Louis Poulsen lamp, the view is of an intimate courtyard setting of white walls, lush plantings, gravel, moss-covered tiles and a rectangular ornamental pond. Another large sliding door allows the dining room to be closed off from an adjoining informal family room and the kitchen, which flow onto an open external timber deck. Finally, a few steps lead down from the family room to the children\u2019s wing, with three bedrooms, a bathroom and laundry. In the 1980s, the Caters sought Russell\u2019s assistance to extend the kitchen, family room and external verandah. Original timber joinery was preserved and seamlessly incorporated into the additions, retaining and enhancing the integrity of the spaces.</p><p>The Cater House is a fine example of late Sydney regional architecture. From the later 1950s, Sydney architects such as Russell were drawn to the work of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright and to the spatial organization and constructional motifs of traditional Japanese architecture. There was great interest in the natural environment, demonstrated by the design of climatic controls, the manipulation of natural light, the orchestration of views and a response to the forms of the landscape. Russell\u2019s houses of the 1950s and 1960s embody these references in gestures such as the clarity of natural materials and construction techniques, the juxtaposition of dark timber joinery and white walls, and the use of sliding doors and screens to manipulate internal spaces and diffuse the boundaries between inside and outside.</p><p>The Cater House was awarded the 1965 Meritorious Architecture Award by the ACT Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. Its lasting merit was acknowledged in 2001 with the Institute\u2019s 25 Year Award, and in 2008 by registration under the ACT Heritage Act for \u201cexhibiting outstanding design or aesthetic qualities valued by the community.\u201d The house has been maintained in remarkably fine condition and Russell\u2019s design has served the Caters well, with family, artworks and books happily accommodated for forty-five years. In 2010, the children have gone and the Caters have reluctantly made the decision to move to retirement accommodation. They hope for a buyer <br />who will understand and enjoy the house for another generation.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A quirky installation hidden within the confines of a typical suburban house in outer Melbourne explores manipulation of space, the flux state between the digital and material world, and the idea of marking domestic territory.</strong></p><p>An inter-war suburban bungalow destined for renovation by Studiobird Architecture and Interior Design has been used for exploration and experimentation. Studiobird\u2019s Matthew Bird and artist and designer Michelle Hamer have collaborated on an installation that examines the idea of treating a traditional domestic space as a dome. When asked why a dome, Michelle responded, \u201cIncreasingly the difference between home and institutional architecture is overlapping. The home is a space desired for events, even special events, similarly to that of a dome.\u201d Michelle and Matthew currently teach at RMIT University. As well as their own investigations for this installation, they have been running a design studio examining the qualities of domes and how these can be incorporated into contemporary design.</p><p>Using only recycled materials, the installation demonstrates how space can be manipulated without major construction. A sense of rotation is given to the rooms, as the repeated patterns have an impetus toward the central oculus (of the dome). These patterns also appear more prominent than the existing framework of the empty house \u2013 for example, the walls appear to dissolve. The effect of the installation is almost disorientating and one feels drawn by the movement and revolutions.</p><p>A richness of pattern and detail references the fluidity of curved forms found within domed spaces. Repetitive laser-cut objects and their offcuts are used in a similar way to a digital pixel. Installed by hand, this installation is in an interesting flux state between the digital and the manual, which both Matthew and Michelle are interested in.</p><p>Sculptural chandeliers hang from each of the main rooms. The bright yellow offcuts fall into a puddle of blue offcuts. These elements bring a splash of colour to the installation, which is primarily composed of black perforations. Within the bathroom, the chandelier is of black rubber gloves, while cut-outs of household cleaning products decorate the walls.</p><p>An empty house is a rare opportunity to consider the composition of domestic space. Michelle and Matthew have demonstrated that space can expand and change through ornamentation and installation, where \u201cimmersive, transitory and sacred spaces are generated.\u201d</p><p>Although there is a more serious research aspect to this work, it is refreshing to see the execution of such playful, yet offbeat conceptual work.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>We look at how the design hotel has developed and uncover some of the newest hotel projects underway by Australian designers.</strong></p><p>The first \u201cdesign hotel\u201d was the uber-cool Royalton in New York, which was opened in 1988 by Ian Schrager with interiors by Philippe Starck. Similar to the concept of the boutique hotel \u2013 which provided an alternative to cookie-cutter big hotel chains \u2013 the design hotel traded on the look of the hotel to attract guests, providing a sense that each hotel was unique \u2013 a design experience in its own right. This new wave of hotels was part of the \u201cexperience economy,\u201d with the interiors becoming platforms for staged experiences \u2013 at the Royalton, the lobby featured a blue carpeted strip which acted as a runway, viewed from the sunken seating areas adjacent. With a more private atmosphere and personalized service, the lobby became a buzzing hub for \u201clobby socializing,\u201d with celebrities frequently spotted \u2013 indeed the Royalton made Starck himself into a design popstar. With the flourishing of the design hotel through the 1990s and 2000s, the category has become a lot wider. Now, design hotels need not be small \u2013 some are very large, with up to five hundred rooms \u2013 and they need not be in the top price bracket \u2013 many more design hotels are available at lower prices.</p><p>With the opening out of the category and the drive to stand out from the crowd becoming more and more pronounced, many design hotels have developed unusual themes and quirky design ideas \u2013 some are downright outlandish. Now we have ice hotels, treehouse hotels, underwater hotels and even space station hotels \u2013 though some of these should be called gimmick hotels, not design hotels.</p><p>Responding to this explosion of a new type, in 1993 Claus Sendlinger started a company called Design Hotels. Each member has its own story, with the creative brains behind the hotel (whether owner or designer) providing vision through cutting-edge design, new experiences and different ways of thinking. With now over 190 hotels as part of the group, Sendlinger has his own criteria for what makes a design hotel. \u201cGenerally we look at the people behind the project and whether or not their ideas and visions fit with ours,\u201d explains Sendlinger. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the design that makes a property a good match for the Design Hotels brand; the hotel also needs to show it has the right personality. Architecture, design, service, gastronomy and lots of intangible qualities must come together like pieces of a puzzle to create a coherent picture.\u201d</p><p>Recent additions to the Design Hotels family include the Wanderlust hotel in Singapore, with design interiors by four cutting-edge Singapore design studios: Asylum has created the Lobby Level called \u201cIndustrial Glam\u201d; :phunk Studio\u2019s Level 2 is a series of vibrant colours; DP Architects has called Level 3 \u201cIs it just Black and White\u201d; and fFurious presents friendly monsters in fantasy-filled rooms. Other new members include Alila in Luang Prabang, Alila Bangalore and Casa de la Flora in Khao Lak, Thailand, all of which will be opening in Asia by the end of the year. Participating in the development of hotels as well as simply collecting suitable members, Design Hotels held a Future Forum earlier this year in Berlin (turn to pages 62\u201363 for more details).</p><p>The only Australian member of Design Hotels is the Limes Hotel, designed by Alexander Lotersztain of Derlot, featuring a distinctive facade with cut-out blob shapes, in Brisbane\u2019s Fortitude Valley. Limes is also part of a new boutique group of hotels called Eight Hotels, which also includes the Diamont Hotels in Sydney and Canberra as well as other Sydney and Melbourne hotels. Most recently, Eight Hotels has launched Paris8 \u2013 a group of six apartments available for rent in Paris.</p><p>Another group of hotels in Australia that has emerged is the Art Series Hotels group. Named after key Australian artists and featuring their work in the rooms, the group has had three recent openings in Melbourne \u2013 the first was Prahran\u2019s Cullen Hotel, followed by the Olsen Hotel in South Yarra and the Blackman Hotel on St Kilda Road.</p><p>Australian art may be one thing, but it is the beauty of nature that has long been the drawcard of Australian holidays. The tradition of the Australian retreat in the bush, rainforest or by the ocean continues. In the following pages we review two new hotels \u2013 Saffire Freycinet, enjoying both coastline and mountains in Tasmania (pages 50\u201351), and Sangoma Retreat in the Bowen Mountains of New South Wales, which provides an intimate boutique experience complete with home-cooked meals (pages 58\u201359). &#160;In the city, apartment hotels have become more popular. The Citadines Melbourne on Bourke is a new hotel designed by a team including Woods Bagot and Multiplex. Citadines Apart\u2019hotels exist all through Europe and Asia, and the concept is \u201cstay your way\u201d \u2013 with flexible options including fold-away doors, TVs on pivots and spaces suitable for drinks, meetings or a yoga session. SJB is also refurbishing the Medina on Crown in Sydney, which will be rebranded as an Adina Apartment Hotel. Offering \u201cmore than just a hotel,\u201d these apartments are designed to be a home away from home. Existing Adina Apartment Hotels are in Berlin, Frankfurt, Budapest and Copenhagen.</p><p>The partnership between Crown and Bates Smart continues, following up the Crown Towers, City of Dreams in Macau and the Crown Metropol, (featured in issue 32 of Artichoke), the new Mahogany Room at Crown Towers will be expanded by almost 50 percent, including a new facade facing Melbourne\u2019s CBD and Yarra River, opening at the end of 2011.</p><p>The large hotels in Sydney are also undergoing change, with a major refurbishment planned for the Park Hyatt at the Rocks in Sydney, courtesy of Bar Studio. And the Shangri-La, also in Sydney, has a few new additions designed by Hassell \u2013 the Chi Spa takes its inspiration from the legend of the Shangri-La and also from the Chinese concept of chi, the gym and pool were upgraded, the Blu Bar and all-day dining venue Cafe Mix were redesigned and a new outdoor dining area was created adjacent to the lobby.</p><p>Hotels by designers, yes, but are these design hotels? To answer, we must look at the characteristics of a design hotel. Whether large or small, luxury, budget or anywhere in between, a design hotel must be individual. If you could mistake it for any other room with a bed and four walls, you are not in a design hotel. That\u2019s not to say that hotels with themes are all design hotels \u2013 for example, a new hotel in Paris called Seven Rooms has a James Bond room and an Alice in Wonderland room, but does it work? Is it aesthetically pleasing? And does it provide a good experience for guests? I remember staying in a \u201cdesign hotel\u201d in Amsterdam which had been converted from an orphanage and then a backpackers and despite, some outlandish lobby furniture and everything in the rooms being white, it was cold. And when we asked for the heating to be turned up we were told it wasn\u2019t possible and were given more blankets. It was design but it wasn\u2019t designed.</p><p>Concept hotels have abounded in recent years \u2013 one recent example is the Treehotel in the boreal forest in Sweden. Inspired by documentary film Tr\u00e4d\u00e4lskaren (\u201cTreelover\u201d) by Jonas Selberg Augusts\u00e9n, the Treehotel includes rooms by various architects and designers with names like \u201cThe Bird\u2019s Nest\u201d, \u201cThe UFO\u201d and perhaps most striking \u201cThe Mirrorcube\u201d by Tham \u221e Videg\u00e5rd Arkitekter, which is literally a cube-shaped room mounted around a tree trunk with mirrors on the outside to reflect the forests that surround it. Other hotels make their mark not through quirkiness or themes but through associating with fashion brands or celebrity \u2013 one of the first was the Palazzo Versace which opened in the Gold Coast in 2000. Other fashion brands have followed suit, not only from the luxury brand category, but also other brands such as Camper. The Spanish shoe brand now has two hotels called Casa Camper in Barcelona and Berlin, with a new one set to open in New York. Another successful fashion-themed hotel is the recent Diane von Furstenberg for Claridges hotel in New York which includes bespoke fabrics and furniture using her bold collection of prints.</p><p>Australia has been slow to take up the concept hotel, although a recent venture by Tourism Victoria and Right Angle Studio called the Lost &amp;&#160;Found Hotel Room made use of a temporary space by setting up a free hotel room which stocked furniture, homewares, music, books and beauty products by local Australian creatives (for more information turn to pages 56\u201357).</p><p>Australian firm PTW is working on the Octopus Hotel, which takes the form of an octopus (tentacles) and has a centre tower that is the shape of a traditional Chinese fishing basket. A luxury resort, the Octopus Hotel will open in Hainan in southern China in 2013. Also working on projects overseas, Australia- and Germany-based LAVA is working on some new hotel concepts, including a new resort and theme park in Mexico and a hotel is part of their plan for Masdar city\u2019s plaza. Masdar is the new planned zero-emissions city which is going ahead in the Middle East. Called \u201cOasis of the Future,\u201d the plaza is built around the central tenet of environmental sustain-ability and also includes a hotel and convention centre.</p><p>These new hotels by LAVA are putting into practice the research learnt from the practice\u2019s Future Hotel Room from 2008, a research project that looked at new technologies to be included in hotel rooms, such as anti-jetlag lighting, active comfort beds and semi-automated production techniques designed to respond to users\u2019 actual needs. Taking research into jetlag and insomnia one step further is an installation for the London Design Festival 2010 called Once Upon a Dream by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur on display at the new hotel Andaz Liverpool Street lounge (lobby). Based on research by Professor Alain Nicolas into the influence of sleep on cognitive functions, Once Upon a Dream gives the user absolute control of his or her environment. Over a fifteen-minute period, a curtain slowly draws around the bed, the temperature slowly moves toward nineteen degrees for maximum comfort, the light slowly extinguishes and there is white noise to prevent any aural distractions. Once the user goes to sleep, a puff of sea air is released into the room at regular intervals, anti-oxidizing and hydrating, as well as rich in minerals to benefit the sleeper\u2019s cellular metabolism.</p><p>This sort of research is vital in the development of hotels. Because remember: at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a design hotel if it hasn\u2019t been designed.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Quirky details and a passion for sport set apart the Middle Park Hotel in Melbourne, combining a gentleman\u2019s sports bar below with fun, personalized rooms above.</strong></p><p>Following several collaborations with Six Degrees Architects in hospitality design, Julian Gerner of the Melbourne Pub Group commissioned the studio to realize his vision for a gentleman\u2019s sports bar concept in the stately Middle Park Hotel in inner Melbourne.</p><p>The downstairs bar and dining refurbishment was undertaken first, with the interior informed by function, flow and the idea of creating different types of worlds. A generous boomerang-shaped bar (seventy metres long) invites people to perch and relax. Bar area flooring is a mix of original mosaic tiles and timber. \u201cWherever possible, if it\u2019s usable, serviceable and it\u2019s there and in the right spot \u2013 then leave it,\u201d says Six Degrees\u2019 Mark Healy of the studio\u2019s approach.</p><p>The client\u2019s collection of historically significant sporting memorabilia was accommodated by the creation of pockets around specific subliminal themes. Nostalgic items include an old bookmaker\u2019s tote bag suspended from the ceiling in a racing-inspired space, while a framed Donald Bradman bat provides a cricket focus. \u201cThere are lots of different little places for different groups and different situations,\u201d Healy explains.</p><p>Referencing the gentlemen\u2019s club era and Raffles style is the varied application of rattan \u2013 to the bar, light shades, screening and as a wall finish. Black-painted formply and hardwood also conveys the idea of timber-panelled dining rooms reminiscent of the old club aesthetic, without being too literal.</p><p>A private boothed section incorp-orates a series of TV screens, preventing their intrusion on the space. A trophy cabinet provides a clever alternative to a screen to signify transition into the dining room where high-value recycling infuses immense character. The timber wall panelling originally lined the walls of the iconic Long Room at Melbourne\u2019s MCG. Bespoke red carpet with repeated insignia of the hotel\u2019s initials, MPH, also recalls the carpet in the Long Room. The ideas also permeate a guest lounge opposite the B&amp;B-style office and a private dining room.</p><p>A grand Victorian staircase leads upstairs where forty-one previously pokey single rooms and communal bathrooms have been converted into twenty-five contemporary hotel suites, the second stage of the renovation. Working in concert with the nooks and crannies, layouts maximize space and address&#160;core functional needs \u2013 a bed, kitchenette, a place to put a case and banquette seating. Pendant lighting designed by Nick Rennie is individually positioned in each suite.</p><p>\u201cThe plan and wall treatments of the rooms are influenced by Katsura, secret puzzle boxes, love hotels and the Tardis\u201d, says Healy. The intent is to provide a tiny home with a little bit of party in it. The palette of marble, timber, leatherette, rattan, mirror and stained hardwood repeats ideas from downstairs against an understated backdrop of white. Ensuite bathrooms are a deliberate mono expression comprising black tiles, white porcelain fittings, marble, glass and neon strip lights.</p><p>Throughout, quirky touches draw attention. Large letters L and G spell out bathroom access in the public space, and were reinstated from the hotel\u2019s former signage. Antler pendant lights in the lobby and dining room, a collection of antique suitcases near the stairs, red X-shaped doorknobs on bedside drawers, suite door tags featuring comedic slogans from the 1970s Sandman Van period and room numbers that were formerly used on cricket score boards are examples of Gerner\u2019s passion for creating unique hotel experiences. That\u2019s most evident in his collection of sporting prints and Rennie Ellis photographs. The Middle Park Hotel celebrates Victorian lifestyle from local-supplier- sourced food, architecture and design, through to the fine details.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A new hotel concept, the Lost &amp; Found is a temporary, free hotel room for sampling the work of creative Melburnians.</strong></p><p>On the day I visit the Lost &amp; Found Hotel, the jackhammers are loud and the doorway is blocked with bits of tin. As it happens, the host building is being torn down to make way for an apartment tower. This idea for pop-up accommodation \u2013 in fact it\u2019s just one room, with a fascinating approach to bookings \u2013 is only possible because soon it will not exist. The Little Collins Hotel (the \u201creal\u201d hotel) that houses the room is within the former Naval and Military Club building \u2013 a 1960s architectural wonder, all blue carpet and wood panelling. Once the nation\u2019s most famous military club, dwindling numbers and bad deals have led to the demise of an organization \u2013 and an incredible space \u2013 that forty years ago had four thousand members and a five-year waiting list.</p><p>That past is partially relevant here. Lost &amp; Found, the name of Tourism Victoria\u2019s e-newsletter for \u201cculturally minded\u201d visitors, is now an inner-city corner hotel room too \u2013 and it\u2019s free to stay for those lucky enough to be selected. Newsletter subscription is the only currency needed and thousands have applied to get one of the nights available over its three months of operation. Some bright thinker at the government agency employed Right Angle Studio to give them a hip injection. The publishing group who created the newsletter has also taken on the role of hotel decorator.</p><p>But it is the story within the stories that is interesting here. The very lovely, if bland, hotel room remains virtually untouched. Rather it is the concept of filling the room with exclusively local stuff \u2013 the furnishings, gourmet snacks, reading material, art, vinyl selection, planters, domestic objects, linen and bath products \u2013 that makes this project. It is a sterling idea to have a curated sleep-over with many of Victoria\u2019s best designers. Indeed, it would be a worthwhile project to get more hotels welcoming visitors to Melbourne by giving them the chance to eat, sleep on, read, listen to and sit on work made here \u2013 an enduring way to experience design.</p><p>There has been a rash of new designer hotels in Australia but sadly most remain ambivalent non-spaces. Instead, invitational design projects such as Lost &amp; Found and rooms like those at hotels like the Lloyd (Amsterdam) or Gladstone (Toronto) are keen to tell us something about the city where we rest our heads \u2013 one set of recognized community members providing for another that is indeterminate and itinerate.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Set facing the Hazard Ranges, Tasmanian resort Saffire offers a holistic experience drawing on the natural beauty of its surrounds.</strong></p><p>The \u201coperational goal\u201d of Saffire is to create lifelong memories for people. This immediately raises the stakes \u2013 no claims here about being \u201cthe best\u201d or \u201cthe most,\u201d it\u2019s more about depth of experience. There is a homely quality, which is something the staff strive to deliver through their natural smiles and attention to detail, committing to memory things you mention in passing and delivering back surprising gifts throughout your stay.</p><p>This is a place very much about location. Architect Circa Morris-Nunn Walker\u2019s contemporary scheme takes inspiration from the coastal setting, opening sightlines toward Coles Bay and the Hazards, while the interior design by Chada was inspired by the natural surrounds in the selection of materials and colour palette. These mountains are icons of the east coast of Tasmania that shroud the renowned Wine Glass Bay just an hour walk on the other side. The main building capitalizes on expansive views from all spaces, as does the entrance pier that projects the newly arrived guest to the highest vantage point. This theme continues in the suites, detached from the main building with large celery top pine box windows framing the vista.</p><p>Custom rugs that reference the local flora and fauna appear throughout the suites and the main building, known as \u201cThe Sanctuary.\u201d While the twenty suites have an international luxury feel, they are imbued with objects, books, materials and finishes that set them apart. Sandblasted grey and red marble and Tasmanian timbers \u2013 mainly Huon pine and celery top pine \u2013 abound in the interiors and architecture. This, combined with the eclecticism of small functional and decorative design features, lends the warmth and comfort of a coastal shack.</p><p>Light is definitely a key feature of the experience of both the interior and exterior of Saffire. David Becker, director of Point of View, charged with the task of lighting the interior and the complex curves and glass walls of the exterior, aimed to use as little light as possible and to focus on the guests\u2019 ability to see the view. Another concern was reducing the external light impact of the building, \u201cpreserving the darkness of the environment as much as possible.\u201d This is sensitively achieved through practically invisible ceiling lighting as well as floor and pendant lamps with zero spill.</p><p>As I write this there\u2019s a wide rainbow slung low across the Hazards clearly visible from the lounge and library areas that are filled with luxury design classics from Walter Knoll, Eames and Artifort. Mixed in with this are solid Huon pine coffee tables propped on large root and burl sections and 2.5-foot high and wide Huon pine stumps also doubling as coffee tables.</p><p>The two-tiered dining room is one of my favourite spaces, elegant and restrained. Leather upholstered pedestal Turtle chairs by Walter Knoll offer comfort and allow the diner a great vantage of the rest of the restaurant, especially from the top level. The feature suspended lights on the upper dining level were commissioned from Hobart-based designer Judith Abell. The downward form of the lights mimics the contours of the Hazards, the perspex rods sparkle, transmitting a fluorescent white light without dominating the tables below. Upstairs on the entry level there is a library lounge that, at night, is dominated by reflections from the large expanse of glass.</p><p>When you go to Saffire, book a spa treatment; I recommend the hot stone massage. Sourced from a disused quarry, the 375-million-year old pink granite stones have been carved and polished by a stone smith. I\u2019m told that this same stone paves the way at the Empire State Building. It is beautiful, local and feels like coming home.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Ministry of Design has reinvented a row of Singapore shophouses as a chic, contemporary hotel that nevertheless references Singapore\u2019s colonial heritage.</strong></p><p>The Club wraps a street corner on Chinatown\u2019s Ann Siang Hill, one of few elevated settings in the flat (or flattened) city state. In the early days of mercantile Singapore, the knoll must have afforded good views of the then-nearby seashore, its proximity provoking a concentration of cheap accommodation and remittance shops. Parallels drawn between the transient tenants of this past and the commercial traveller of today are a launching point for this project.</p><p>The Club is the first foray of Harry\u2019s Hospitality into hotels, its usual business being a very popular chain of occidentally-oriented bars. Ministry of Design (MOD) developed the concept and branding for the property and designed the accomm-odation and public area interiors and graphics. Jane Yeo, experienced in creating Harry\u2019s more traditional drinking holes, was responsible for the off-lobby lounge and basement tapas bar, both of which revel in much deeper tones, primarily red.</p><p>The L-shaped building of the Club was originally a row of shophouses, a Singapore typology of storage or retail space at ground floor and living space above. Over the years, the individual slices were consolidated and the interiors merged and stripped. Despite its apparently orderly exterior (unified by fresh white paint), the envelope did not yield any \u201ctypical\u201d room types \u2013 rather a chocolate box of different forms and flavours.</p><p>The hotel is entered from a chamfered corner, the lobby formed a little like the famous Aalto vase. A cloud of folded fabric drops from the ceiling, obscuring the outlook of a super-sized Sir Stamford Raffles, reminding us of the other great colonial hotel in this city.</p><p>Artwork by Wyn-Lyn Tan, inky sketches of plum branches on the walls and swallows in relief on the ceilings, leads us to the guest rooms on the second and third floors. The curvilinear corridors are simply finished with white paint and silvery carpet, but the door to each room presents a safe-like assemblage of rotating cogs and levers. These discs, in lieu of the usual swingtags, communicate messages like \u201cI need nothing, I feel content\u201d and \u201cOrder <br />for me (please make up my room).\u201d</p><p>The twenty-two rooms are monochromatically decorated with a restrained palette of three materials \u2013 carpet, timber and paint, accented by a suite of shiny lamps. Each room on the floor is unique, space dominating structure in all but one, where the columns are used to advantage in the creation of a posted bed. Fabrics and carpets are white and a silky, sterling grey. The room extends through glass into a bathroom of super-scaled black and white diamonds with a console-like vanity.</p><p>Public areas are furnished with a curated selection of classic and custom pieces. The rooftop pavilion serves dual purpose as breakfast room and bar. Its sunny terrace transforms before sunset at seven as the tables fill with young profess-ionals, and the mood of the main room is modulated by varicoloured light emitting from punched patterns on walls and ceiling.</p><p>Nimbly navigating between the aesthetic extremes of containerized \u201cinternational travel modern\u201d and op shop baroque, MOD has created in the Club a cool, compelling and personable retreat. A contemporary take on colonial chic that, in celebrating historical context, defines an experience unique to&#160;\u2013 and unique in \u2013 Singapore.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>With three suites and home-cooked meals, this retreat in the Bowen Mountains provides a home-style bush experience complete with Glenn Murcutt\u2013inspired architecture.</strong></p><p>Standing on the terrace at Sangoma Retreat in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, it\u2019s hard to believe that this majestic site was once occupied by a semi-fortress complete with moat and bunker. What was heavy and inward looking is now open and light, as an elegant steel and glass structure rises from the bush, exposing the sweeping views below. Fortunately for weary city-dwellers, this is not only the home of former art consultant Michael Podles and stylist Zenga Butler, but also a luxury retreat.</p><p>\u201cWe used to own a weekender in the area and jumped at the opportunity to purchase the plot when it came up for auction,\u201d explains Podles. \u201cSeeking a dramatic lifestyle change, the site ticked all the boxes. We wanted to fuse the tranquillity of country life with the pleasure of entertaining people in a relaxed setting. Building a retreat seemed like the perfect match.\u201d</p><p>For two years during construction, the pair operated out of a tiny caravan, collaborating with architects and a team of local builders. \u201cWe had a clear idea of what we wanted, but tight planning laws, restricted access to the site and a change of architects meant a longer process,\u201d says Podles.</p><p>The duo are justifiably proud of the secluded lodge which is defined by four buildings: the main house and three mini-lodges sensitively placed in the landscape. \u201cWe were greatly influenced by Glenn Murcutt\u2019s work,\u201d Podles explains. \u201cIt\u2019s become an almost classic Australian response to designing in a rural context. His use of simple materials and practical design really resonated with us.\u201d With Murcutt in mind and a restricted budget, the owners settled on a simple and cost-effective materials palette of steel, glass, corrugated roof sheeting and raw concrete blockwork. A potentially cold selection, but teamed with personal and rich interiors, the combination is anything but chilly.</p><p>Walking up the landscaped drive toward the main house, a glimpse of the entertaining space comes into view. The dining room marks he centre of a double volume space with views to all sides of the property. A few short steps lead to the intimate lounge area which is mapped out with oversized furniture and innovative light fittings, many of which the duo designed themselves. The two up-lighters are salad bowls, painted black, and retro-fitted with low energy lamps, while the dining table chandelier is composed of painted and punctured metal tubing fitted with LEDs and hung with wire from the ceiling.</p><p>The couple spent many months curating the spaces, including a lengthy buying trip to their native South Africa. \u201cWhile the lodge is distinctly Australian in context and design, it is South African in spirit,\u201d says Podles. Some of the standout pieces include reclaimed wood frames, bold African textiles and green wire chairs from Malawi.</p><p>The three suites extend the style&#160;of the main house. The concrete blockwork, Fijian timber and steel are offset with unique, hand-picked features. The pool suite, for example, has a summer feel, complete with striped cabana, Indonesian sun&#160;bed and lap pool. Other design elements include limestone-clad Philippe Starck baths, fireplaces, four-poster beds and patchwork leather cladding.</p><p>\u201cAverse to five-star-hotel stuffiness, we wanted to create a homely, personal environment,\u201d explains Podles. \u201cWe cook all the meals over the course of the weekend. It allows our guests to really unwind.\u201d Brunch on Sunday is a communal affair served on the deck. \u201cWe feel that the combination of the design and our approach to hospitality has resulted in an unconventional guest experience.\u201d Based on the wide grins at the table, it seems to be working.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>PMDL brings soft lake-side colours indoors at Sydney MGSM business school\u2019s hotel.</strong></p><p>A palette of languid, lake-like colours informed PMDL\u2019s design concept for the recent refurbish-ment of the Macquarie Graduate School of Management (MGSM) Hotel in North Ryde, Sydney. Dark, glassy greens and sheets of slate grey create a segue between the interior and the tranquil lake-side setting of the forty-room hotel.</p><p>Simon Fallon, senior associate at PMDL, who undertook the interior refit of the original Cox Richardson-designed hotel, said, \u201cThe most exciting aspect of the scheme was its extraordinary situation in the midst of a landscape reminiscent of (renowned eighteenth-century English landscape architect) Lancelot \u201cCapability\u201d Brown, but filled with contemporary sculptures.\u201d</p><p>The hotel pavilions or bungalows are verandahed to take in the sculpture park, the lake and its environs, originally laid out by Context landscape architects. Fallon says, \u201cThe curatorial department at the university, headed up by Rhonda Davis, began collecting contemp-orary sculpture many years ago. The sculptures and the almost English garden plan are juxtaposed to the native plantings.\u201d</p><p>All these elements provided the cues for PMDL\u2019s approach to the interiors. \u201cOnce the palette was determined to provide a seamless transition from interior to exterior, the other features just fell into place,\u201d Fallon says.</p><p>That palette is very specific. The green seems to be that still, opaque green only seen in still bodies of water like lagoons, meres and lakes, and the grey that of their loamy banks. Fallon has applied this green evocatively to the bathing area. While the bathrooms were perhaps the biggest challenge, being small and claustrophobic, PMDL has turned this to advantage, summoning up the lake using reflective and opaque surfaces and colours to provide a sense of seclusion rather than enclosure.</p><p>The texture of the furnishings also echoes the exteriors \u2013 grainy, wooded and matte. The sculptural quality of the deep grain American oak dining table with its baobab-like plinth references the objecthood of the artworks strategically positioned outside and the brick-ish coloured earth, paving and grain of the gums. The hewn tree stump stools reinforce the effect of the table. Fallon says, \u201cOnce we had referenced the lake and the sculpture, we needed to reconfigure the space to take advantage of the window and verandah, consolidating the context and upgrading the aesthetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething as simple as placing balcony furniture on the verandahs took the look and feel of the scheme from a motel to a studio apartment aesthetic. Likewise, placing the desk at the window so occupants \u2013 often academics \u2013 can write looking out across the park, and positioning the chaise longue to take in the view gave the rooms a sober, contemplative but sophisticated ambiance. The overall effect is calm, peaceful and interesting without being distracting.\u201d</p><p>Remarkably, not only did PMDL bring the project in on time, meeting the two-month timeframe while keeping half the hotel open to minimize disruption to guests, but also brought it in under budget. Fallon pays tribute to ISIS construction and the project managers, in particular Peter Keenan, Paul Opie and Shelvie Lee, in achieving this feat. Not only is the client thrilled with the project and its progress, but so are customers, with occupancy having increased dramatically.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Hybrid thinkers go beyond the boundaries of convention at the sixth Design Hotels Future Forum in Berlin.</strong></p><p>Hosted by Claus Sendlinger, founder and CEO of Design Hotels, the Future Forum was held this June in Berlin to deal with the subject of \u201cHybrid Thinking\u201d in the context of hospitality.</p><p>This year, for the first time, Design Hotels teamed up with DMY, the International Design Festival in Berlin, and with the Bauhaus Live Workshops of the Bauhaus Archive. The sheer number of events meant that Berlin turned into an arena for the discussion of architecture and design this June.</p><p>The speakers at this year\u2019s Future Forum were pioneers and personalities from the fields of hospitality, architecture, design and art. The symposium, which took place at the Bikini House in Berlin\u2019s Charlottenburg neighbourhood, kicked off with a welcome event following the topic of \u201cChallenge Your Senses\u201d by Ottmar Pohl, chef de cuisine at Cosmo Hotel in Berlin, Hans Becker, chocolatier from Lapp &amp; Fao, and winemakers Ir\u00e8ne Tolleret and Michael Trenz.</p><p>On day two, Chris Sanderson and Martin Raymond of the Future Laboratory in London gave an insight into social movements and business trends of the coming years. Dr David Bosshart, CEO of the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institut in Zurich, outlined why hybrid thinkers have the ability to shape entire industries. Editor-in-chief of Frame Robert Thiemann then presented a vast selection of hybrid concepts from around the world, followed by Sissel Tolaas who talked about her fascinating work as a smell researcher, chemist and scent artist. Tolaas, who has exhibited at MoMA in New York, is a professor at the Harvard Business School, and works with international companies. Finally Lars Kr\u00fcckeberg and Wolfram Putz of Graft architects, Berlin, spoke about interdisciplinary techniques and global networks, before designer Werner Aisslinger presented the top ten design talents from this year\u2019s DMY.</p><p>Hybrid thinkers blend different skills and fields of thought to develop innovative concepts. Hybrid thinking requires much more than a multidisciplinary team \u2013 it requires a team of multidisciplinary people. Like-minded hoteliers around the globe have begun to create hybrid properties. Multidimensional hotel concepts focusing on authentic experiences are on the rise, combining elements from galleries, hospitals or film theatres with the traditional idea of hospitality.</p><p>Aimed at investors, forward-thinking hoteliers, architects, designers and creative minds, the symposium served as a very good platform from which to predict the future of the travel industry. Three major trends emerged.</p><p>\u201cBetapreneurs\u201d describes a new entrepreneurial mindset that is about an understanding of business and possibility that is formed entirely by knowledge of the web and the power of launching ideas in \u201cbeta\u201d mode into the non-virtual world. Their approach is flexible, daring, risk-friendly, small-scale, networked, highly responsive and in continual development, perfectly suited to these unpredictable and volatile times.</p><p>\u201cLeanomics\u201d is the approach of creating a lean and efficient business with economic criteria and simple, clean, social, natural and aesthetic messages and products \u2013 basically, a decluttering environment with cognitive simplicity, to allow a recreational and unobtrusive residence for the guests.</p><p>\u201cValuenomics\u201d describes the blurring of value and economy. Customers turn away from mass markets and chain hotels to look for a more individualized niche market. They expect an encounter, an experience or a story, which means a holistic hospitality concept. More and more the human side of dealing with different people gets into focus, \u2013 the hotel as a social hub.</p><p>At the end of the day, the perception of hybrid thinking in terms of hospitality is summed up into the fusion of multiskill, open-mindedness and creativity coupled with lots of passion. Already, visionary hoteliers around the world have started to create hotels that are far beyond the original purpose of simply providing a bed.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>From hotel desk ergonomics to the proper placement of toiletries, hotels offer a compelling mix of emotional triggers for female guests.</strong></p><p>Seeing hotel spaces from the eyes of hotel guests can offer illumin-ating perspectives on hotel design that influences guests\u2019 emotions. I recently conducted research to understand female business travellers\u2019 hotel stay emotions and explore design opportunities that enhance hotel stay experiences. In one part of the research, female business travellers were asked to take photos of objects, places and events in hotels that triggered their emotions during stays, offering insights on the ways guests perceive hotel spaces.</p><p>Female business travellers pay close attention to subtle details in hotel environments. The most important triggers of pleasant emotions are guestroom facilities, bathroom facilities, decoration, interior layout, gifts and furniture. They expect to be cared for, to have fun exploring sensations and to enjoy restorative experiences.</p><p>Hotel guests take cues from hotel environments to judge whether hotels care about their guests. In pleasant experiences, hotels are interpreted as \u201ccaring spaces\u201d in which physical elements become the manifestations of the hotel\u2019s caring service spirit. Female business travellers feel well cared for when a hotel\u2019s design shows anticipation of guests\u2019 needs,&#160;offers good-quality choices and communicates goodwill.</p><p>For example, Sophia was impressed by the fine workmanship and materials of the furniture in her room, expressing the designers\u2019 effort in ensuring guest comfort.</p><p>Lorna was pleased with the user-friendly set-up of the desk in the hotel room. The ergonomic details were well considered, including adequate lighting with adjustable angle, large desktop space, conveniently placed electricity sockets, easy connection to the Internet and a handy telephone. In other cases, details as small as bedside accessory containers, cotton pads and wall-mounted hooks for hanging clothes were appreciated.</p><p>From the perspective of the guest, the quality and user-friendliness of hotel amenities are indicators of the hotel\u2019s \u201csincerity.\u201d Detail-oriented design transforms the hotel into a caring space.</p><p>During business trips, female business travellers like to feel they are in a different locale, explore local specialties and experience new or unusual sensations in \u201cexplorative spaces.\u201d Pleasant emotions in hotel stays are triggered when the design satisfies this need for exploration.</p><p>When travelling to Japan for business, Natalie was delighted to stay at a traditional-style hotel. The guestroom was an explorative space that offered an authentic taste of Japanese culture as she dressed in yukata, sat on the tatami floor, appreciated zen-style decorations and tasted local tea and snacks. The cultural ambience was cohesively expressed through all interior design elements.</p><p>Views from the hotel room\u2019s window are also an important explorative element that triggers pleasant emotions. Hotel guests enjoy watching what is going on outside and getting a sense of the place\u2019s character. One female business traveller remarked, \u201cThe view from the window means discovery.\u201d</p><p>The most basic purpose of the hotel is for guests to relax. Good design of \u201crestorative spaces\u201d in hotels contributes greatly to enjoyable hotel stays.</p><p>Female business travellers regard the bathroom in a hotel room as a refuge to cleanse, revitalize and start a day. They care significantly about bathrooms, from hygiene to spatial arrangement and practical details. They are pleased when there is sufficient light for make-up, storage near the basin for skincare products, shelves for storing clothes and toiletries to try out.</p><p>The design of an in-room relaxation corner also makes a difference. Female business travellers often took photos of the corner of the room with an arm-<br />chair, foot rest and a coffee table. The corner represents the enjoyable time after a busy day \u2013 be it sipping a cup of tea, reading a magazine or simply dozing off while watching TV.</p><p>Decorative elements that convey warmth and a sense of nature often evoke pleasant emotions by enhancing restorative experiences, such as fresh flowers, stylish lamps and warm colours.</p><p>Female hotel guests notice the positive impacts of hotel design in what I have termed caring spaces, explorative spaces and restorative spaces. By designing hotel rooms according to these three areas, designers and hoteliers can tap into positive emotions in a way that is meaningful and will keep guests coming back for more.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>The multisensory qualities of space offer design possibilities beyond the purely visual.</strong></p><p>\u201cYou stand at the table shuffling papers and you drop something. Only you don\u2019t know it. It takes a second or two before you know it and even then you only know it as a formless distortion of the teeming space around your body. But once you know you\u2019ve dropped something, you hear it hit the floor belatedly.\u201d Don DeLillo<sup>1</sup></p><p class=\"x-scan-body-text\">Although we are to some extent aware of our visual involvement in space and time, we are less aware of the multisensory qualities of our experience as we move through space, over intervals of time. In Western design culture, sight has historically been regarded as the most important of the senses \u2013 often at the expense of the others. Juhani Pallasmaa argues that the dominance of the eye tends to push us into detachment, isolation and exteriority,<sup>2</sup> and yet we are seduced by our enigmatic and fundamentally narcissistic encounter with the object qualities of the world.</p><p>The international&#160;design press supports and even celebrates this hegemony of sight. For many of us, the photograph is as close as we will get to an experience of most architectural projects. Accompanying text often reiterates that which is visible from the image and rarely describes the invisible qualities of the projects involved. This dominant publishing paradigm contributes to the visual flattening of a complex, multisensory experience of space. Architecture is reduced to the role of iconic object and thus to a recognizable commodity.</p><p>Haptic perception is a term used in psychology to describe a holistic way of understanding three-dimensional space. This system of environmental perception goes far beyond visual spatial perception and refers to a more complex experience integrating senses such as touch, positional awareness, balance, sound, movement, curiosity and the memory of previous experiences. This combination of sensibilities has been referred to as simultaneous perception.<sup>3</sup> A space can be understood and appreciated through its acoustic resonance as much as through its visual shape. The most persistent memory of any space is often its smell. We feel air and light move against our skin and yet these are considered to be background experiences that rarely enter the published discourse on architectural space.</p><p>In the Memory Void of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, cast-iron faces are scattered thickly, almost discarded on the floor of the wedge-shaped space. Sounds leak out, pre-empting the visual encounter. A harsh clanking erupts whenever someone walks over this surface of souls. This experience may be imminent, but it is not apparent from a photographic image of the space. The door to the Holocaust Tower pivots open to an apparently empty, darkened void and gravel floor. Twelve metres up, a wall patch is illuminated by the smallest of openings, through which not only light but the smell of damp darkness and the sounds of the outside world seep through the cold, thick concrete shell. Your eyes adjust, as they always do. Only now do you see the crowd that you somehow felt, standing silently in the gloom, like you, breathing the air and saying nothing. This is Libeskind\u2019s \u201cend of all voids,\u201d an externalized interior \u2013 something he hopes every participant in the museum will experience as \u201chis or her absent presence.\u201d<sup>4</sup></p><p>The atrium of Donovan Hill\u2019s addition to the Queensland State Library provides access in all directions, at all levels. Although visually striking, this is not primarily a visual space \u2013 it remains one of heat and humidity. You have moved to, through and in, without using a door. Once again, you are inside and yet you are not \u2013 you are simultaneously here and there.</p><p>Tokujin Yoshioka wants occupants of his work to feel light with all the senses. Through the use of \u201cnatural phenomena and invisible elements such as sense, wind and light, the presence of the object is eradicated ... it is as if the physical presence of the object has been uprooted and gives life to a \u2018floating scenario.\u2019 \u201d Yoshioka\u2019s latest project, Sensing Nature / Snow, is simultaneously silent and dynamic. Although physically excluded, we are seduced by the possibility of immersion.</p><p>The haptic qualities of these projects are not incidental but fundamental to their conception as trans-active, participatory environments. In the act of designing, non-visual senses need to be more than just visual qualifiers. For this to occur, a variety of \u201cplace learning\u201d methods will be increasingly important in design education. The manner in which we publish architectural projects will need to use images and text to construct a holistic, vicarious experience. But if we continue to emphasize focused vision at the expense of the peripheral senses then, in the words of philosopher Guy Debord: \u201cAll that was once directly lived will become mere representation.\u201d<sup>5</sup></p><h6>1.

            "content": "<p><strong>Greg Natale\u2019s interior for the new Uscari store is raw and industrial, a perfect complement to the style of this young Australian label.</strong></p><p>There is no mistaking the look interior designer Greg Natale and client fashion designer Krystel Davis wanted for her new retail store, Uscari. The stage lights and clothes racks made from downpipe are a dead giveaway. \u201cWe wanted something raw and industrial, first and foremost,\u201d says Davis, founder of the local fashion label that has taken a comfortable place among the usual suspects like General Pants and Witchery inside the new MidCity Style Space complex in Sydney\u2019s Pitt Street Mall, the first new retail destination unveiled as part of the CBD\u2019s retail transformation.</p><p>The Uscari label began in October 2008 and opened with Davis\u2019s third season. The young designer works with a variety of texture, binding and panelling in her youth-oriented label and, like many fashion designers, fabric choice and fine detailing are fundamental to her work. This made it easy for Natale to find a focal point for his design \u2013 a mixture of raw, industrial materials and sharp angles. For instance, picking up on the client\u2019s love of binding, the designer chose to expose most of the screws used in the fitout. \u201cThe design is completely inspired by the clothes \u2013 Krystel uses lots of different textures and layers so we wanted to reflect that in the store,\u201d he says.</p><p>The brickwork for the side walls is painted white to provide a simple urban backdrop for the clothes on the outer walls. The floor, which appears to flow seamlessly to the ceiling, is made from fibrous concrete, usually used as an underlay for bathroom tiles, cut out in triangular shapes and lacquered for glamour.</p><p>Quadrilaterals, polygons and other geometric shapes are followed through with the terraced prism, also made from fibrous concrete \u2013 a theatrical centrepiece for displaying a few of Davis\u2019s key pieces. The angles and shapes are carried through on the design of the shop counter which uses a combination of matt and gloss white tiles imported from Italy. However, it\u2019s when Natale employs positive and negative space with an angular mirror and door-less entrance to the fitting rooms that the geometric design is achieved most successfully. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in exploring interesting shapes. I\u2019m sick of the same old U-shapes that you see everywhere, especially in Sydney, and I think the combination of panelling and cut-outs I used here is resolved really well,\u201d he says.</p><p>Once inside the fitting rooms, the curtains drop waterfall-like from the angled ceiling of the otherwise stark space. Davis sourced the fabric herself and sees the curtains as a key feature of the store design: \u201cLayering is very important to me. I also wanted something light, so I went for pure white cotton that has a crushed look and I think it works really well \u2013 I wanted dreamy curtains.\u201d The carpet further softens the spacious changing area juxtaposed with a raw steel Tolix chair in each cubicle.</p><p>The industrial theme could have been something so literal as to be unpleasant but, in fact, the result is something subtle that provides an appropriate platform for showcasing the work of a local talent who\u2019s catching the interest of the fashion world. </p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Michael Young has been living and working in Hong Kong for four years \u2013 here he discusses the benefits of living at the gateway to China.</strong></p><p>Snubbing the world of celebrity design and avoiding becoming what he calls a \u201cEuropean design casualty, wandering from trade fair to trade fair,\u201d Michael Young moved his studio to Hong Kong in 2006. An industrial designer through and through, Young works directly with engineers and factories, even developing software in his studio and building the machines themselves to push the boundaries of technology. China is the world leader in the manufacturing of technology and electronics, and the mix of this and the focus on entrepreneurship in Hong Kong is the perfect fit: \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of a market desperate for design and the highest levels of technology,\u201d explains Young. \u201cIt\u2019s how design was in the 1950s when the war finished \u2013 factories needed designers and started developing good objects, and that\u2019s how it feels. We\u2019re dealing directly with people who own the company.\u201d</p><p>When I spoke to Young in Sydney, he was just about to speak at an Authentic Design Alliance event on replica furniture. While Young is scathing of replicas, it is his perspective from the point of view of Chinese manufacturers that is fascinating \u2013 he doesn\u2019t blame China for fakes because the demand for replica furniture comes from the West. Instead, he speaks passionately about working directly with manufacturers in China to create new products \u2013 and tapping into a huge local market.</p><p>This experience working with manufacturers and companies in China and Hong Kong is the subject of a new book he is co-authoring with John Hackett, former head of design at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The book is called Works in China and charts Young\u2019s experience working with five manufacturers in China: Giant bicycles, Ostbahn aluminium, Zixag bags, and Native Union and EOps electronics. The idea behind the book is to provide an interview-based research document that looks at the process of manufacturing in China. When the book is complete, Young plans to take his products by the five companies and exhibit them, along with the book, on a roadshow around the world, acting in part as a guide for designers on how to work in China.</p><p>From his base in Hong Kong, Young also continues to work with European brands on new products, such as his Lancaster chair for Emeco. For this chair, his experience in manufacturing and technology once again came to the fore \u2013 it is one of the first die-cut aluminium chairs. Most aluminium chairs are pressed, but Young has managed to create a die-cut for the metal that does not end up with holes, but with a smooth finish.</p><p>Also utilizing new technologies to create stunning finishes is Young\u2019s newest project, the DuPont Corian showroom in Shanghai. A stunning white space furnished with Young\u2019s own products and furniture, the studio shows off the potential of the DuPont Corian material. A CNC machine was designed and built to realize the main curved wall in the space, made with thousands of bricks to create a single solid structure. \u201cWe developed the software in our studio,\u201d explains Young. \u201cNormally, you have to have certain angles on a surface, but now you can do multi-directional things which haven\u2019t ever been done before in surfaces. It\u2019s the most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>So, what\u2019s next for the designer? He plans to open a series of Michael Young shops selling his watches and other products, developing his brand in China. \u201cWhen I started, the companies I met with were all wanting to sell in Paris and New York. Then they realized we\u2019ve got the biggest market under our eyes in China.\u201d</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Formway\u2019s Kent Parker discusses the art of conversation, how to accommodate different postures and the new Be chair.</strong></p><p>There are always changing trends with workplace design, exploring how we should work, interact, collaborate \u2013 and it\u2019s on the move again. In the new workplace, there is less of a formal shift between individual and collaborative working styles. People do their own thing. And the result is a natural movement based on conversations.</p><p>This is the philosophy for the Be chair by Formway: to support the different postures, styles and conversations that happen from the task chair. Kent Parker, lead designer of the Be chair, says they set out to make a chair that was different from the others.</p><p>Formway\u2019s research has found that people cannot maintain one posture throughout the day \u2013 you need to move to communicate. Seventy percent of conversation is non-verbal \u2013 things like expression in people\u2019s faces, eyes and body language. Parker explains, \u201cYou can tell when someone\u2019s on the phone and the conversation gets a little heated \u2013 they\u2019ll move in different ways.\u201d Subconsciously, the body also moves and shifts to relieve pressure and maintain blood flow. Formway tested various styles of seating and measured the effects on the body. The chair supports subtle changes of posture, reinventing it in a healthy way and allowing the body to move. It\u2019s not encouraging people to sit badly, but they\u2019ll do it anyway.</p><p>The chair back and seat is made from a flexing polymer by DuPont, which has been used extensively in high-wear, high-stress environments such as suspension in cars and engine mounts for twenty years. Both the front and sides of the seat flex, allowing blood flow through the legs and supporting various postures. The back does the same, allowing the chair to turn from a high-back task chair to a low-back side chair by applying pressure to the back. You\u2019ll find the usual seat depth and seat height adjustments, but the Be chair is more intuitive by relying on the flex of the material to provide the adjustment.</p><p>Formway has gone into the design with a different environmental approach \u2013 by using like materials in similar components. \u201cIt\u2019s about the product not only coming from a like source, but actually being able to be recycled quickly.\u201d There is also a plant-based biopolymer in the pipeline.</p><p>The Be chair is at the same level as the Life chair in terms of price. Currently, there are only black (Onyx) polymer colour options here in Australia and New Zealand, with several colour options for the Be chair (Knoll Generation chair) in the US. Time will tell whether they will make it over here. There is a range of coloured seat fabric options, a choice of polished aluminium or nylon base and additional arm types.</p><p>Overall, the chair is visually very clean. It\u2019s honest, well engineered and it makes sense. Formway is excited by this chair: a new philosophy for a new conversation.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Inspired by, among other things, beetles, trees, nature and Michelangelo, this exhibition at the VaA in London explores small structures.</strong></p><p>Informed by ideas about retreat and refuge, seven small buildings were recently constructed in the galleries and circulation spaces of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London for the exhibition 1:1 Architects Build Small Spaces. After nineteen architectural practices from around the world were initially invited to submit concept models and drawings, seven proposals were selected for construction at full scale. \u201cThis gave each of the practices their first opportunity to build in the UK,\u201d says curator Abraham Thomas. The resulting diverse designs respond to the ornate interior architecture of the museum without compromising their individual aesthetic, characterized by an honest approach to materiality and construction.</p><p>Five buildings located within the permanent spaces of the museum are very successful. Two located within the architecturally characterless temporary exhibitions space have less impact, although dance and drama perform-ances might animate them. Japanese interior architecture is renowned for attention to detail within small spaces. Terunobu Fujimori\u2019s timber Beetle\u2019s House perches on four spindly legs in a semicircular, glazed courtyard. It complements two sixteenth-century oak structures, a French staircase and an English facade. Its interior is perfectly fitted out to enable a handful of people to sit and take tea. Sited on the landing outside the Architecture Galleries, Sou Fujimoto\u2019s Inside/Outside Tree is constructed from colourless acrylic sheets, fastened with cable ties. Folded in three dimensions, its continuous external and internal surfaces resemble a folded sheet of origami paper. Unlike the Beetle\u2019s House, it is only possible to stand at its threshold (engawa), which is an important concept in Japanese houses. The cable ties resemble white blossom, an unanticipated effect which delighted the architect.</p><p>Rintala Eggertsson Architects designed Ark, a skeletal tower constructed from Finnish pine which rises through a stairwell connecting the ground-floor bookshop with the National Art Library on the second floor. Appropriately for a Norway-based practice, the resinous wood evokes mountain huts and a Nordic affinity for nature. Its \u201cwalls\u201d are formed by metres of shelved books, whose inwardly oriented spines provide colour and enable people to choose one to read. The edges of the books\u2019 pages, their colours ranging from recently published white to the yellowed pages of second-hand books, create the tower\u2019s subtly coloured exterior. Climbing further, the tower sways with each footstep, evoking windblown treetops.</p><p>Outside, in the museum\u2019s courtyard garden, another Norwegian practice, Helen a Hard Architects, has constructed Ratatosk, an ash tree gazebo. Its four columns resemble pillars of archaic classical temples and the contorted forms of mythical trolls, acknowledging and subverting the surrounding Renaissance architecture.</p><p>The fifth building, Studio Mumbai\u2019s In Between Architecture, was inspired by a narrow infill house near the firm\u2019s studio. Sited in the Cast Courts, its tiny windows provide incongruous glimpses of classical casts, including Michelangelo\u2019s David. The London building provides an insight into how an Indian family of eight used the now-demolished multifunctional living spaces.</p><p>The two buildings which suffer by neither complementing nor reacting against the museum\u2019s architecture are Woodshed, by Rural Studio, USA, and Spiral Booths, by the Brazilian practice Vazio. The former is raw and austere, while the latter\u2019s booths flaunt theatrical red velvet curtains.</p><p>The proposals of all nineteen practices, including Melbourne architect Sean Godsell\u2019s Picnic Table House, which has a dual function as a nocturnal shelter for homeless people, are displayed in the Architecture Gallery. When the exhibition ends, the buildings will be auctioned, to cover costs and raise funds. Seven winning bidders will be able to site a building within their own house or garden. Ark could house an extensive library, but requires a very large house; whereas the Beetle\u2019s House would enhance a small garden.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Pushing the boundaries of timber, Sydney-based Japanese designer&#160;Koichi Takada takes us through two&#160;of his latest restaurant designs.</strong></p><p>\u201cMy work is often concerned with the invisible,\u201d says Koichi Takada. We are standing under his forty-thousand-piece balsa chandelier at the Ocean Room in Sydney Harbour. \u201cIn every project I try to respond to a central idea that affects the senses, but in a subtle, indiscernible way. Sound, shadow, light and texture \u2013 these are ideas that really excite me,\u201d he explains.</p><p>Looking up at Takada\u2019s simply enchanting installation, it\u2019s evident that movement is another we can add to the list. \u201cWhen the breeze from the ocean sweeps into the restaurant, the individual dowels become animated as they undulate and clatter in the wind,\u201d he explains. The sculpture was also intended as a dialogue with the iconic Opera House just across the water.</p><p>Takada, originally from Tokyo, has been living in Sydney ever since collaborating on an invited competition for the Museum of Contemporary Art. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in London, Singapore, Hong Kong, New York and Tokyo,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m happiest in Sydney. There is a balance between nature and urbanity here which is a concept that resonates strongly in my work. It\u2019s also a distinctly Japanese approach.\u201d Takada has imbued the Ocean Room interior with the luxurious and edgy feel of an inner-city hot spot but with a considered response to the harbour beyond. \u201cWe also emulated and enhanced the fine food dining experience through the use of delicate and muted materials,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe customer is always foremost in my mind and every design decision revolves around how it would feel to be in the space.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s an idea that Takada has pushed to the limit in another of his latest projects, a Sushi Train franchise restaurant in Maroubra which he has dubbed \u201cThe Cave.\u201d \u201cIt was my umpteenth restaurant interior for the client,\u201d he explains. \u201cI felt that, based on the brief and our history, it was time to push the boundaries. My first instinct was to address the issue of acoustics \u2013 most popular establishments are really noisy. It is important to me that my design results in a comfortable and pleasant place to eat.\u201d</p><p>Through an intensive process of experimentation with various materials and their acoustic properties, Takada generated the idea of a cave-like shape, composed of laminated plywood pieces, forming the walls and ceiling of the space. Each curved shape, a number of biscuit-jointed segments, was then cut using sophisticated three-dimensional programming tools before being manually fitted together on site. The result is astonishing \u2013 a muted decibel level, even when the restaurant is at capacity. It\u2019s a similar experience to standing in the Ocean Room where the sound-absorbent qualities of the timber keeps the background buzz to a minimum.</p><p>Aside from an inherent complexity, Takada\u2019s designs are often labour intensive to construct. The Ocean Room required two tonnes of steel and a painstaking labelling and installation process. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do it without the support of our wider team,\u201d explains Takada. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative experience. As designers we need to translate our three-dimensional concepts into legible construction drawings so that they become realistic constructs. This is critical in ensuring successful projects.\u201d</p><p>Takada is also passionate about the design process, evident in both schemes. \u201cWe often work in section as a way to explore the possibility and viability of our designs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe document the journey of every job. By doing this, we are constantly aware of our goal \u2013 the experience of the end user. It is critical to design for others and not for yourself. What would be the point of that?\u201d</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Cafe Bourgeois by Minifie van Schaik Architects provides a retreat for Melbourne\u2019s Docklands office workers, complete with op-art wallpaper.</strong></p><p>Contemporary urban design flourishes despite the most stringent limitations. Everyone wants maximum effect for minimal expense, to stand out while fitting in. Among the signature high-end corporate edifices of Melbourne\u2019s Docklands \u2014 the ANZ, NAB and Fujitsu buildings with their postmodern ornamentation and vast logos \u2014 Cafe Bourgeois occupies a slice of the ground floor of the Myer National Support Office, designed by BVN Architecture. Obviously, office workers need somewhere close by to eat, but they also need to feel they\u2019re really taking a break from their workplace. Given BVN\u2019s monumental grey cube of glass and steel, any local cafe design needs to have a casual flavour but without compromising the sophistication of the precinct. That\u2019s what Cafe Bourgeois sets out to do.</p><p>Positioned just to the left of Myer\u2019s main entrance, Cafe Bourgeois\u2019s identity was the latest in a series of collab-orations between Jan van Schaik from Minifie van Schaik Architects and Andy Sargent from SouthSouthWest. The brilliant wallpaper design dominates photographs of Cafe Bourgeois, a gargantuan post-Riley op-art ripple which swirls across two walls, up onto the roof and down across the floor, resulting in a continuous architectural synthesis of lights, visuals and ergonomics. It\u2019s a highly economical solution, too, a simple sticky-back vinyl print. Yet the striking photographs don\u2019t do the subtlety of the interior justice. The juxtapositions effected by the ripple unify the diverse zones of the cafe, from the dangling hula-hoop spangled with tiny LED string lights to the display cabinets, jazzing up the ambience without overwhelming the space.</p><p>One inherent difficulty of designing such spaces requires enhancing function without obtrusiveness \u2013 nobody wants to feel that they\u2019re being too obviously directed this way or that. With a pair of long tables to the left, the rear of the space is lined with a very comfortable timber banquette. The bench joinery is Ecoply, veneer panelling made from renewable plantation pine, with its end-grain expressed. Lighting is primarily provided by a row of task lighting distributed above the back of the bench. The floor is lined with Marmoleum, made from natural materials including linseed oil, limestone and resins, and with bactericidal and expansive properties, making it an ideal floor surface for a commercial space.</p><p>As you\u2019d perhaps expect from an establishment named Cafe Bourgeois, you\u2019ll find baguettes, crepes (both savoury and sweet), coffee and cakes. And the new interior makes this a very pleasant place to go for a coffee or something to eat. </p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A complex functional brief on a difficult corner site adjacent to the heritage St Vincent\u2019s Hospital, BVN\u2019s new O\u2019Brien Centre was an architectural challenge.</strong></p><p>Amalgamating three previously separate services \u2013 drug and alcohol, community health and mental health \u2013 the O\u2019Brien Centre at St Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Darlinghurst, Sydney, had a highly complex brief. BVN Architecture was appointed to take up the challenge which was all the more difficult because of its site \u2013 a narrow corner block on Victoria Street, directly adjacent to the heritage deLacy building.</p><p>The first architectural decision was to celebrate rather than obscure the facade of the 1890s heritage deLacy building. By pulling the O\u2019Brien away from its neighbour, a courtyard was created on the street corner and the deLacy facade is revealed with its fine details, period corbelling and 1930s colonnade. The western facade of the O\u2019Brien building, made of 182 panels of perforated bronzed anodized screen, provides a contemporary counterpoint to the existing building without over- powering it. On the places where the two sites border one another, the deLacy building is used on a number of occasions as a screening device in the many courtyards and outdoor areas of the O\u2019Brien building. This way, the heritage look is revealed, while acting as a physical barrier to enclose and protect patients.</p><p>The operational brief of the building is complex, requiring facilities for a range of patients with different special needs, as well as having to be serviceable for visitors and providing a workable, positive environment for staff with often-stressful jobs. Rather than making assumptions about the way that hospitals are usually run, BVN\u2019s design approach focused on the functional brief and how best to create a building to service those needs. \u201cWe looked at things like how people experience the building, how you use natural light, the importance of staff, the importance of visitors,\u201d explains BVN principal Tracy Lord. \u201cQuestioning what\u2019s going on, why things are a certain way, and considering it as a piece of architecture rather than a clinical space.\u201d</p><p>Another of the major architectural decisions was to put an atrium in the middle of the building, creating a stairwell from levels three to seven, with a glass roof and glass facade. This solved a number of problems associated with the unusual site as well as allowing natural light to filter into the core of the building and allowing views out. \u201cOne of the problems with traditional hospital design is that corridors are enclosed,\u201d explains Lord. \u201cWhat was important for us is not just that it\u2019s nice to see outside and get the sunlight but also that it\u2019s easier to understand the building.\u201d</p><p>Incorporating the research and development of commercial workplace design, O\u2019Brien\u2019s staff areas were set up to encourage collaboration and communication between staff. Open meeting areas, large function rooms and other spaces for bumping into one another facilitates the cross-pollination of the three previously separate services. \u201cWe used things that in the commercial sector are taken for granted but in the health sector haven\u2019t come through yet,\u201d says Lord.</p><p>And because the building is brand new, light and open with well-considered functional spaces, the experience of the space is ultimately more positive for staff and for patients alike. \u201cIn the end it boils down to having a nice environment to feel comfortable in,\u201d says Lord. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a director\u2019s office or a mental health bedroom, there still needs to be the same amount of care and love to <br />the project.\u201d</p>",

Fleeting as that may be in terms of time, the residual benefits are far more permanent.</p><p>The pop-up fashion store was a final-year project for nine Queensland University of Technology (QUT) students who were the first group to graduate from a combined business and fashion degree. The degree is the first of its kind in the country, although others have since developed.</p><p>As part of an \u201centerprise learning\u201d program, the student cohort was supported by both the Wintergarden, who provided the store, and QUT Creative Enterprise Australia (CEA). In keeping with all this pioneering spirit and striving forth where no man/woman has trod before, the store showcased independent fashion labels (including some of the students\u2019 own) and emerging local designers mentored by the CEA program. Thus, some award-winning local talent on the up and up (in the likes of George Wu, Juli Grbac and Robyn Taggart) mixed it with the babes in the wood fresh out of fashion school.</p><p>Fashion lecturer and program coordinator Kay McMahon oversaw a rigorous preparation schedule that involved thorough feasibility studies and business plans, financial management, projections and marketing schedules through to the complete store fitout and stocking. A gala opening event was also organized by the students. For a university whose motto expounds its relation to the real world, the model is very relevant.</p><p>Realism aside, fashion is also a great vessel for fantasy and creativity, and the store revelled in an inspirational and innovative fitout as a stage set to its unique stock. Working within a limited budget and, unusually for the pop-up model, multi-layered shopping centre regulations, the group became hunter gatherers. Preloved objects were sourced to create an eclectic atelier atmosphere that reflected the vibrant communal nature of the enterprise. Thus, balls of yarn threaded their way around the space inhabited by dirty paintbrushes, old candel-abra, suspended origami sculptures and a wall of hand-illustrated chalkboard. Mesh, fishing line and cables assisted in displaying garments. A ripple iron stand with a pink onyx top made the perfect counter. A curly wire hanging basket \u2013 \u00e0 la Nanna\u2019s patio perhaps \u2013 was a feature in the front window. Old soft drink crates helped form the roll-away landscape.</p><p>The effect was, according to McMahon \u201cinviting, homely and akin to a busy artisan\u2019s studio.\u201d In the longer term, the students were able to significantly develop their design portfolios and generate concrete retail opportunities.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Hosting a combination of French and Chinese cuisine, the interiors of this restaurant by Buro Architects move gradually from dramatic dark to light and airy.</strong></p><p>Way back in 2007, news broke that the Kam Fook Group, respected purveyor of yum cha through numerous gargantuan Sydney outlets, was planning an audacious French\u2013Chinese culinary chimera for Melbourne\u2019s QV complex. Highly regarded restaurant designer Buro Architects was linked to the project, and Melbourne\u2019s tr\u00e9s refined (and bloody parochial) foodies \u2013 newly softened up on the decadent fare of imported Sydneysiders such as Neil Perry and Guillaume Brahimi \u2013 held high expectations.</p><p>Weeks passed, then months. Tidbits of information trickled out through foodie blogs and newspaper columns, but the boarded-up shopfronts on Artemis Lane gave nothing away. Months ran into years, prime ministers came and went, and expectation gave way to a suspicion that this Duck Duck Goose may indeed have been cooked. And then the doors opened!</p><p>According to Buro\u2019s Stephen Javens, the restaurant is far better for the extended gestation. \u201cOften restaurants are designed and delivered with a high level of commercial imperative,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really nice to consider things over a longer period. We spent a lot of time discussing the diner\u2019s experience.\u201d</p><p>Walking in from the street, you do get the sense that nothing has been spared in creating this place. Owner Edward Ng\u2019s initial inspiration for twin French\u2013Chinese restaurants came during a tour of Rheims and Champagne, and the entrance to the French fine dining side of Duck Duck Goose, with its low ceiling and Jonah-and-the-Whale-style metal ribs, was designed to evoke those regions\u2019 famous caves. The concept plays out in experiential rather than literal aesthetic terms \u2013 the passageway acts as a point of reset, giving visitors time to adjust to the new environment and avoiding that common experience of entering a dining room and being shocked by its cacophony, colour and movement.</p><p>The entrance draws neat parallels with the QV complex itself (featured in Artichoke 09), which is characterized by small openings and narrow laneways that intersect at odd angles and open suddenly into larger volumes. Here the passageway opens into an unapologetically luxurious champagne bar. An ornate pressed metal ceiling catches the eye immediately, and soft metallic curtains wash the space in a golden glow while the bar itself \u2013 generously proportioned and stocked with an outstanding selection of fizz \u2013 is a refreshing antidote for anyone tired of rubbing shoulders in yet another hole-in-the-wall CBD gin joint.</p><p>Buro has capitalized cleverly on the constant changes in floor level here, a legacy of the car park below, to subtly demarcate different zones. From the champagne bar, a short flight of steps takes diners up to the fine dining restaurant. The steps are flanked by dark timber screens that help to define the boundary without blocking views and sounds.</p><p>This subtlety does not, however, dilute the impact of entering the dining room proper. The space is imbued with an undeniable sense of tranquillity and refinement. It\u2019s a fine dining restaurant like they used to make them, and how refreshing!</p><p>Black chairs are matched to black marble tabletops, black curtains along the walls and carpet so dark you can only just make out a pattern, all arranged around a massive marble-clad pool. Its surface transforms light from an array of pendant lights above into gently chaotic patterns. The constant movement brings the space to life, and its quiet burble creates natural white noise that reduces the audibility of neighbouring conversations and quashes any temptation to play muzak.</p><p>The fine dining restaurant and champagne bar are collectively known to staff as the Dark Side. Its casual Cantonese twin, the Light Side, is an airy procession of eating areas that cascade like a terraced garden and flow down to QV\u2019s main plaza. There are tables, banquettes, alcoves and bars for sampling dim sum and drinking tea, and the views between levels and out through windows provide a greater sense of space than experienced in the Dark Side. However, disparate as the two sides seem, they are linked by a shared selection of furniture, fittings and materials \u2013 black marble tables and chairs, for example, are replaced by white and blonde versions, respectively; dark-stained timber floorboards are repeated sans stain; and the marble water feature is re-imagined as a square, white stone dim sum servery at the ground floor entrance.</p><p>In a transitional passageway that links the two restaurants, a series of private dining rooms feature elements from both \u2013 inky carpet from the Dark Side, for example, and American oak joinery from the Light Side. Diners here can order from either menu, and enjoy a direct line of sight into the huge twin stainless steel kitchens.</p><p>Perhaps, then, this is the best place to ponder the multiple personalities of Duck Duck Goose. On paper, it reads as Yin and Yang, dark and light, night and day, but this implication of dichotomy is misleading. It is a French\u2013Chinese\u2013Sydney\u2013Melbourne thing, after all! Accordingly, Buro\u2019s fitout isn\u2019t all black or white, but evolves slowly as you pass through it, successfully accommodating a seemingly impossible diversity of experiences \u2013 from a five-minute t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with a basket of steamed dumplings at one end, to a fifty-dollar glass of champagne at the other \u2013 in a seamless and singularly elegant whole. </p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>The design of this Melbourne massage school by Red Design Group blurs the boundary between graphics and interior design, with striking results.</strong></p><p>When a fitout and a logo are both designed by the same firm, where is the line drawn between interior architecture and graphic design? In the new national headquarters of the Australian College of Massage (ACM), South Melbourne, interdisciplinary practice Red Design Group started with the logo. After fifteen years, ACM wanted to move, grow and refresh its identity. The existing logo was an abstract organic shape that could be seen as representing hands, or a pair of human bodies. Red graphic designer Sarah Hotchin tweaked the shape slightly and changed its colours from blue and yellow to shades of green, expanding its symbolism to embrace nature.</p><p>\u201cEverything came from the brand,\u201d explains Emma Schaeche, interior designer at Red. The revised identity for ACM was based around the feel of being in a relaxing massage environment \u2013 ACM students receive a Diploma of Remedial Massage after a year of study, and the mostly-female graduates generally seek employment in day spas. To use Schaeche\u2019s expression, ACM is a \u201cboutique offering\u201d as distinct from its competitors which are more generalist institutions like TAFEs.</p><p>Red Design Group is led by a managing principal with a background in business marketing, the science behind retail sales and branding strategies. At Red, graphic designers work alongside interior designers, architects and visual merchandizers. \u201cIf we get to create a brand, that sets the tone for the rest of the design,\u201d says Schaeche. They began by sourcing a huge library of hand-drawn images of flora and human anatomical studies. \u201cWe thought they were really in tune with each other, the human body and nature, so we entwined them,\u201d say Schaeche and Hotchin. The choice of illustrations over photography was a deliberate one, creating a point of difference to competitors who, in this field, tend to use photographs of relaxed-looking people with big smiles. \u201cBut those photographs always age,\u201d explains Hotchin.</p><p>So, from a logo and a marketing brochure that \u201creads\u201d like a relaxed massage, to an educational space that feels like one? \u201cThe colours we chose were replicated throughout the space. It blurs the distinction between graphics and interior design,\u201d says Schaeche. The entry reception has a spotted gum timber floor that wraps up one wall, to create a warm and inviting feel. The wall behind the reception desk displays the logo surrounded by illustrations of leaves. Statements sourced from ACM\u2019s educational ideals are applied to the walls, in various shades of green type. From the waiting area, sight lines lead to another ACM logo on the far wall.</p><p>The existing space was an open-plan office, uninspiring apart from an unusually tall ceiling. New walls were introduced, demarcating office space, the two large teaching rooms, and a break-out area with a kitchenette and communal dining table in timber. The existing carpet was removed and replaced with grey recyclable carpet tiles from Interfaceflor. Neutral colours dominate, plus the signature green. \u201cEmotionally, green is time-going-fast, but calming as well,\u201d explains Schaeche.</p><p>Much of the furniture is from Interstudio, including organic coat hooks that mirror the anatomical graphics on the walls. The coat hooks and their placement were pivotal parts of the teaching program at ACM. \u201cThey pride themselves on how they do the draping, so you feel comfortable,\u201d explains Schaeche. The students learn in pairs, each massaging the other in turn. The distance between disrobing and the massage table needed to be as short as possible.</p><p>Initially specifying block-out blinds to the street, the designers are happy with the cheaper alternative of opaque vinyl. \u201cIt creates a light-box effect on the inside,\u201d says Schaeche. And, as elsewhere, the vinyl carries marketing messages, this time addressing the street. Light filters from the front training room into the one behind via a clerestory window high up in the partition.</p><p>Is this interior architecture with applied graphics, or a three-dimensional brochure? Two other training facilities have been constructed in Sydney and Brisbane using the same formula, the same colours, the same library of illustrations. Surprisingly, the building was ahead of the printed word \u2013 when I visited, they didn\u2019t have their new brochures printed yet.

            "content": "<p><strong>The Alannah Hill Sydney store and Melbourne headquarters by David Hicks show how feminine beauty can still be achieved via rationalized design.</strong></p><p>Alannah Hill is one of Australia\u2019s most coveted women\u2019s fashion designers. So distinctive is her style that it can risk misinterpretation when translated into interior design.</p><p>\u201cI love pinks and creams and the whole Marie Antoinette world with a slightly skewed modern edge to it. My look is very ornamental and grand, with a little edge for the absurd and dangerous. Girly, modern, a little bit vintage yet a little bit fabulous, coquettish, very sweet and often dramatic, twirly, girly, naughty flashes of wonderment. My look is love,\u201d enthuses Hill, whose weakness is beautiful, expensive fabrics.</p><p>Impressed by David Hicks\u2019s work, Hill cemented her intuition in an initial conversation, that he not only understood what she was about but would also set some boundaries. \u201cDavid Hicks instinctively knew how to calmly tell me that I couldn\u2019t have a giant snow dome of bows in the middle of a room, but I was very happy when he said I could have a gas fire burning brightly in a mirrored wall.\u201d</p><p>Hicks perceived his client\u2019s penchant for flowers and pretty things as having \u201cexquisite simple taste.\u201d Sensing a desire for a new direction, he approached the design of Alannah Hill\u2019s Oxford Street, Sydney, store by \u201cincorporating a modern feel with an undertone of the things that Alannah likes.\u201d It\u2019s about complementing the designer\u2019s tailored clothing by creating a backdrop that is simple, stylish, modernist and clean, but garnished with what Hicks calls \u201csome nice bits and pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe job was also about branding Alannah Hill from a design point of view, so whoever goes past can recognize the shop as hers,\u201d he adds. Close collaboration between the two parties arrived at the perfect pink that would say \u201cAlannah Hill,\u201d in addition to a pared back palette of quality materials to strengthen the brand.</p><p>Structurally, the dilapidated Victorian building underwent major work to open up the 21 m \u00d7 7.4 m space and to maximize ceiling heights. The project\u2019s triumph is in the role decorative elements play in concert with measured design and detailing. The Bisazza mosaic floor, which references a dress pattern, transitions to custom pink carpet. Pink painted walls and ceiling can be read as skin.</p><p>The bevelled mirror-panelled counter is a modern take on Victorian detail while vintage Parisian chandeliers conjure thoughts of a beautiful brooch, characteristic of the finishing touches to Alannah Hill designs. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a beautiful framework then embellishing it with accessories,\u201d says Hicks.</p><p>Storage is concealed behind a thirteen-metre expanse of doors boasting panels of embroidered silk fabric from Switzerland. Achieving three panels per fabric width highlights Hicks\u2019s strategy of applying budget for impact, often on more tactile elements.</p><p>Alannah Hill designs are showcased in inserted mirrored alcove shelving and a racking system that imbues a jewellery-box feel. The idea of borrowing from different eras is at play in the change room area, with its Hollywood lighting and large pivot doors adorned with generous knobs and tassels. These touches, along with Knoll Tulip chairs and raised circular sections of ceiling, bestow femininity.</p><p>In Melbourne, Hill\u2019s brief for a new headquarters called for the transformation of a derelict warehouse into what Hill describes as \u201ca modern, girly, light, airy, feminine, sexy, expensive glamour house.\u201d A new concrete floor was poured downstairs, the entry area polished, while the main work area for design and production to the rear was finished with black gloss epoxy. The original timber beam and truss ceiling was sandblasted to return integrity to the industrial setting. White painted walls and ceilings ensured a blank canvas.</p><p>Branding themes were replicated from Oxford Street, \u201cto bring in all the things that Alannah wanted without trying too hard, keeping it nicely detailed and simple,\u201d explains Hicks.</p><p>A sheer curtain cocoons a seating area in the lobby to again impart femininity. A custom-made circular rug featuring love hearts and cursive writing \u2013 \u201ckiss me, spank me, touch me\u201d \u2013 in pink tufted silk, announces that this is a unique office space. The effect is repeated upstairs in the designer\u2019s sanctuary. Here, raised sections of timber flooring accommodated plumbing for a bathroom at one end of the space and kitchenette to the other, avoiding structural interference. Both amenities illustrate Hicks\u2019s use of insertions. The mirror-clad bathroom is box like and precious in form. The wall behind is opulently decorated in Missoni Aeonium Karoo fabric panels and combines with the Rosa Norvegia marble vanity to reinforce the \u201cgirly Alannah Hill interior,\u201d says Hicks. Meanwhile, a benchtop in DuPont Corian Glacier White, white cabinetry and pink marble terrazzo flooring make for a very modern kitchen.</p><p>Sublime chandeliers were sourced to poignantly accentuate particular spaces. Furniture throughout in all white comprises a mix of vintage styles including Knoll chairs and tables and assorted antique Louis chairs, some upholstered in exceptional fabrics.</p><p>Both projects are an extension of the residential work of Hicks, which he describes as \u201cvery heavily detailed, using beautiful materials, very luxurious, with lots of modernist elements to it.\u201d They also speak of Hicks\u2019s affection for that transition from the very decorative period to the modernist era, very timeless, glamorous and very considered, as if the best pieces were chosen and put together.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Design Nest\u2019s new Student Learning Centre at the University of Queensland provides a casual, flexible, cave-like space.</strong></p><p>A recent visit to my alma mater, the University of Queensland, was revealing. Things looked pretty similar on the surface, with the addition of a slew of new buildings. Penetrating the halls and bowels of some old haunts soon unearthed the existence of swanky new \u201clearning centres.\u201d Back in the day, a carrel in the library was the only venue on offer for study, other than swathes of cut grass in the quadrangle or by the lake. Now, students have drop-in service centres for internet connection, trysts of all varieties, DVD watching or snoozing between lectures. Not surprisingly, the Student Learning Centre in the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Science was also conceived as a promotional marketing tool for the faculty. Design Nest\u2019s renovation of the space channels all the stimulation, fun and insouciance of student life. The meeting/study/eating/resting place runs a line between chic rumpus room and cool library sans the librarians (and books).</p><p>The existing besser block room with one window, fitted out with twenty-four computer terminals sitting in rows, presented a bleak environment for a faculty that wished to promote its \u201ccutting-edge-ness\u201d to potential students. Design Nest\u2019s Paul Jones quickly decided against a cluster of \u201cColes-cafe-style tables and chairs\u201d as the upgrade solution, and instead incorporated the brief\u2019s requirements of fixed and stand-up computers and media booths into a more inspirational setting.</p><p>So inspirational is the new room that it has earned the nickname \u201cKakadu\u201d from the Head of School and others, in honour of its cave-like feel and the students\u2019 inventive way of imprinting their hands into the lush depth of brown shag pile carpet running up the entry wall. Jones confesses the hand impressions weren\u2019t forecast but are a delightful surprise and attest to a fond adoption of the space by its users. The entry sequence plays to advantage the position of the room on a subterranean level at the end of a long corridor. Its remoteness and underground feel are heightened but also rendered alluring: a glass wall and pivoting door allow views from the other end of the corridor on to the downlit \u201ccave wall.\u201d Turn left and you step into the space proper, with the ceiling height dramatically rising along with light levels.</p><p>Notions of earthiness and landscape in the entry foyer are elaborated in the mini-landscape of the main room. Jones created a terrain of varying levels that establish different zones within the seventy-six-square-metre setting. Loose furniture is kept to a minimum. Lolling and draping over the various platforms, ledges, banquettes and ottomans is the order of the day. In a gesture to the mini-landscape, the raised platform has green shag pile carpet \u00e0 la grass. As Jones notes, elevating a section of the floor provides 75 percent of the furniture.</p><p>Jones is an old hand at designing for university use, having completed libraries, office fitouts, seminar rooms and laboratories in the past. The work has given him plenty of time to observe student behaviour and, in the true spirit of social science, he was able to apply his behavioural observations well here.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d noticed that students were commonly perched in hallways on the floor, using their laptops. They don\u2019t pine for furniture \u2013 they\u2019re young and flexible,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThe idea of putting in nice furniture and dressing it in trendy claddings was problematic. It gave the room a short lifespan \u2026 it would only ever be as nice as the pieces in it. Students like to rearrange spaces anyway.\u201d</p><p>The raised green platform is lined with white leather-look padded walls and a banquette. The white wall is applied to the original that recedes behind it by virtue of black-out paint. The pitch of the original ceiling is also negated by the strong white horizontal element. The platform is as much lounge room as green lawn. A large light hangs over a timber ledge, reminiscent of a hearth. The ledge acts as desk, seat, backrest, balustrade and bed.</p><p>Two media booths sit in the adjacent lowlands, where the natural light is tempered by filtering blinds on the windows. A central dividing plinth houses two large LCD screens back to back. A terrace of vinyl seating and scattered ottomans forever changes shape around the two areas. A custom-designed acrylic light box is suspended above the central furniture plinth. In keeping with the earthy palette, the acrylic is sandwiched with brown sprigs of hand-laid meadow grass. Mirrored walls enlarge the space and add a touch of nightclub luxe.</p><p>Jones is pleasantly surprised at the uptake of the room. \u201cBefore, hardly anyone came down here; now you often see thirty or so people here,\u201d he says. The design has become a test case for building a room-as-furniture and manipulating 3D planes. As always, a good client who was willing to listen and take the journey was an essential ingredient. He endorses the openness of university clients, noting that \u201cnothing is new to them.\u201d </p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Splinter Society\u2019s approach to the interiors of AJF Partnership is part of a paradigm shift toward creative workplaces, hopefully making us less stupid.</strong></p><p>Splinter Society is the design studio that was given the task of making over the new premises of AJF Partnership in just eight weeks. They have come to be known as a young design team adept at creating impressive interior effects out of relatively meagre means and of working with existing material and infrastructural constraints, which also fits the sustainability statement noted on client AJF Partnership\u2019s website.</p><p>In the new offices of AJF Partnership on Level 11, 31 Queen Street, Melbourne, with a jaw-dropping view out across the Yarra River, a design vision was realized from a hybrid concept of lofty warehouse meets quasi-industrial space, with added indoor greenery. It is a workplace for creative types whose job it is to convince us which objects and experiences we should desire as global consumers from different taste communities. It is a place where creative, marketable ideas need to be produced, developed and stored for possible repackaging. There is even the almost imperceptible rumble of the plant room in the background to offer the diffuse aural sense of concepts being constructed. Before the upgrade, this level was entirely occupied by a plant room, meaning that a considerable part of Splinter Society\u2019s design task was directed at dampening this rumble, as well as dealing with the existing carpet and ceiling panels.</p><p>On entering, rather than being met by the standard reception desk greeting, you encounter a large log (yes, the kind that once stood in a forest), horizontally suspended and now sprouting sturdy indoor plants and a curtain of hanging vines. Beyond the foliage can be seen lines of desks and workers \u2013 this is the accounts and finance section and, before long, someone will emerge out of the forest to offer directions. The visual metaphors are mixing already, because below the log there stands a marble bench, or perhaps it is an altar to the art of brand commun-ication, and its plinth is composed of clusters of white pipes. Further clusters of purposeful-looking black PVC pipes divide the desks beyond, carrying electrical and communications cables down from the ceiling. They are not there just for the sake of appearance, but perform a task. An additional sculptural flourish is created out of an array of thin black bands. Pipes, plants and bands create a cross-fertilization of visual cues that speak of verdant biotechnological-cum-industrial prowess, or maybe it\u2019s just an implicit message about sustainable productivity? What is it that we are doing when our work is to produce ideas or concepts for consumption?</p><p>In her provocatively titled book Stupidity, Avital Ronell describes her concern that work makes people stupid, depriving them of essential types of non-production, meditation and play. She argues that \u201cit becomes ethically necessary to find a way rigorously to affirm nonworking, to subsidize rest, laziness, lolling around.\u201d And yet, even ethics requires an effort. The genre of work she is referring to is that brand of alienated labour that reduces the worker to a mere cog in the larger machinery of what is to be produced, stockpiled, marketed and then made obsolete so that the next best thing can be made. Presumably the factory worker or unskilled manual labourer, and especially the sweatshop worker sewing our branded jeans in the developing world best fits this picture today. But the work of immaterial, creative labour that takes place in an advertising and communications firm, or in a design studio, incorporates play into its everyday tasks, making them seem less onerous and presumably making us, the creative labourers, less stupid?</p><p>Almost immediately on entering AJF Partnership the casualization of the workplace is impressed upon the client or visitor. There are soft bench seats extended along the periphery of windows, offering the democracy of a view to all employees. There are communal tables around which to gather to informally discuss the latest brand pitch, to sip lattes or share some wine at after-hours presentations. Importantly, there is a full-scale espresso machine to be discovered in the kitchen pod, which looks more like your funky local cafe including the requisite blackboard wall. There is even a table soccer game under the stairs.</p><p>Curiously, and this is something that took the partners of Splinter Society, Asha Nicholas and Chris Stanley, by surprise, the creatives decided that they wanted to be located not in the lofty volume of the new office where finance and accounts are now found, but in the hothouse intimacy of the mezzanine level. Here, they are divided two by two amid triangular screens that are resolutely not walls, but furniture partitions, pin-up boards, as well as triangles of glass upon which flashes of inspiration can be whiteboard-scribbled. When we visit the office, all their necks are craned forward and faces aglow with the luminescence of computer screens. Downstairs the casual areas are also in good use, giving the sense that the office can be occupied in a diversity of ways.</p><p>If repetitive and menial labour makes us stupid, tasks that become habitual, however interesting in the first instance, can likewise turn us into drones with rigidified opinions. The conceit of the casual-ization of the workplace \u2013 Google\u2019s office interiors can be considered exemplary here \u2013 is that if we allow play, flexibility and a more informal approach into the workplace then productivity can be maintained, even improved. Because I want to refrain from working too hard on a serious question here, I\u2019ll resist asking whether this ploy to design more pleasant places in which we can undertake our material and immaterial labour also makes us more compliant and amenable and less critical workers. What we do know is that work is dominating more of our lives, so we can at least applaud attempts to make the workplace a more comfortable habitat.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>What makes a design studio tick? We ask Melbourne-based product designer Kate Stokes, also known as Coco Flip.</strong></p><p><strong>What work does your design studio do?</strong> Coco Flip works on a diverse range of creative projects. The main focus is on furniture, but the studio also offers graphic design including branding, layouts and web design, as well as interior design and event management. Coco Flip was set up as a base to take on a variety of projects rather than being restricted to one design discipline.</p><p><strong>How big is your team? </strong>At the moment it\u2019s just me, which has both ups and downs. It enables me to have complete creative control over all aspects of the studio, but at times I long for a helping hand! I work from a shared studio space in Melbourne with eight others so it\u2019s not as lonely as it sounds. I have regular contact with manufacturers, retailers, clients and other designers and I really value their input and support. My partner is also a designer and he\u2019s great to talk through ideas with. I\u2019m planning to expand the team eventually, but in the meantime I like to collaborate with other designers as much as possible.</p><p><strong>Where are your design projects located?</strong> Coco Flip is based in Melbourne and currently has furniture stockists in Melbourne (Tongue and Groove) and Sydney (Workshopped). I\u2019m passionate about working locally and believe the Australian design industry has a lot to offer. I\u2019ve also been involved with some hospitality interiors such as Little Creatures\u2019 Loft in Fremantle and Melbourne\u2019s Little Creatures Dining Hall, as well as a refit of Superfino Delicatessen on Flinders Lane in Melbourne earlier this year.</p><p><strong>Do you prefer to draw by hand or by computer?</strong> I usually start the creative process by hand drawing in cafes or other public areas. I find it helps to remove myself from my computer and other desk distractions when I\u2019m beginning a new project. The computer plays a vital role in developing designs and details, so they go hand in hand. If I had to choose one writing instrument it would be the Artline 0.4 in black, hands down.</p><p><strong>Are you a left or a right brain designer?</strong> Probably more left brain \u2013 I\u2019m quite analytical. In saying that, I think it\u2019s really important to tap into the open creativity of the right brain, especially early in the design process, so I\u2019m constantly swapping between the two.</p><p><strong>Which project are you best known for?</strong> I\u2019m still in the very early stages of my practice, so I\u2019m just starting to build the studio profile. The Coco pendant has recently received a lot of press and won three awards at Fringe Furniture this year \u2013 it\u2019s the first furniture piece I have put into production.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s your favourite finished project so far?</strong> Furniture design is my passion and what I enjoy most about my practice. It presents many challenges and I love the process of developing a product from a concept on paper to a tangible object \u2013 it\u2019s extremely satisfying.</p><p><strong>What do you wish you did more of?</strong> So much! I\u2019d like to collaborate with other designers more as I think it\u2019s&#160;a great way to keep challenging your own skills. I\u2019d also love to get involved with some creative installations and interesting hospitality interiors. I want Coco Flip to keep evolving as a design studio, and I\u2019m really open to experimenting with new concepts and briefs</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>As the Australian population surpasses the twenty-two million mark, when do we stop ignoring the important questions and decide how and where we\u2019ll put future generations?</strong></p><p>On Australia Day 2010 the resident population of Australia was 22,130,912. Australia\u2019s population is currently increasing&#160;at the rate of one person every one minute and eleven seconds. Although the media has mainly been using a figure of thirty-five million, the Australian Bureau of Statistics forecasts that&#160;by 2056 Australia\u2019s population could reach 42.5 million. Either way the infrastructure, housing, work and social opportunities that define Australia\u2019s current quality of life will need to be doubled in just four decades. The Australian dream of a house and garden in a suburban milieu has never been in greater demand and its sustainability never more tenuous.</p><p>Since 1788 Australia has always grown rapidly. But whereas in the past this was associated with progress, it\u2019s now being associated with crisis. Indeed, nothing can grow forever.</p><p>While scientists have largely given up on finding a precise carrying capacity for this big brown land, in 2002 the CSIRO concluded that Australia could sustain fifty million people \u2013 that is, fifty million leading what was referred to as a \u201cmoderate lifestyle.\u201d But Australians are not moderate; we have one of the highest ecological footprints on the planet. That means it takes five times as much stuff to sustain one Australian as it does the average world citizen. To put it another way, if everyone lived the way we do we\u2019d need five earths to plunder. So who\u2019s going to tell the Chinese, the Indians and the Africans that they can\u2019t have the quality of life we take for granted? This century\u2019s biggest issue will be about how to lift billions of people out of poverty and do so with just one planet.</p><p>Due to urbanization the global population is predicted to stabilize mid century at around 9.5 billion people. In that context, Australia\u2019s predicted growth from twenty-two million to thirty-five or even fifty million people appears relatively trivial. But of course, it isn\u2019t. For the population to double in just four decades means enormous development. It means we need to build one Sydney or one Melbourne every decade between now and 2060 (Figure 1).</p><p>Although the Rudd Government, through the Council of Australian Governments, made a start, there remains no coordinated, national planning for this kind of growth. Australian cities and towns have largely ignored the issue of where and how such large numbers of people will live. Our cities have simply sprawled, under the radar. But now things are different. As Secretary to the Treasury Dr Ken Henry asked in 2009 in response to Rudd\u2019s \u201cBig Australia,\u201d \u201cWhere will these (extra) people live \u2013 in our current major cities and regional centres, or in cities we haven\u2019t even started to build?\u201d The answer is probably all of the above.</p><p>While Australia feels like a big country, it has real limitations. Only 10 percent of it is arable and it\u2019s the driest place on earth. Australia currently feeds fifty million people, but to do so whole bio regions have been converted to monocultures reliant upon over two million tonnes of fertilizer per annum. There are untapped resources in the north but it\u2019s hard to get these resources to southern populations. In the south, the Murray-Darling is in a state of palliative care and the West Australian wheat belt is suffering salination. These landscapes are likely to come under even greater stress as places like Australia will be expected to increase, not decrease, yields so as to help feed a global population of 9.5 billion, a billion of whom are currently malnourished. As Australia gets hotter and drier due to climate change, our sustainability will depend upon technological advances in food production and water sourcing and recycling. Technology will also need to be applied to reconstructing habitats. Our sustainability will ultimately depend upon whether or not we can secure the nation\u2019s biodiversity.</p><p>The other limitation to growth is cultural, not environmental. Australians are used to a certain quality of life and a big part of this is a sense of spaciousness in our residential areas. Generally speaking, communities see increased density as a threat to their sense of place and resist it. What makes population growth now so different from any other time in our history is that for the first time our cities are evidently struggling to cope. In Sydney, services are collapsing and the only available land for further development is the city\u2019s remnant food bowl, unless anyone is prepared to countenance developing its national parks. Brisbane\u2019s laid-back lifestyle is a fading memory as it morphs into a two-hundred-kilometre blur from the Gold Coast to the Sunshine Coast. Melbourne\u2019s urban growth boundary has snapped and the flood gates for massive new tracts of suburbia have opened, while Perth is already the most sprawled city on earth but likely to reproduce itself once over in the next forty-five years. What form of transport will hold it all together?</p><p>Whereas in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century rampant urban growth was a sure sign of progress, the progressive city of the twenty-first century will be one that can adapt effectively to environmental limitations and infrastructural overload. But cities are cumbersome, deeply entrenched structures and urban planning is often a blunt, bureaucratic instrument of change. The challenges of twenty-first-century urbanism require new means of inspiring and effecting change. Above all, they require creativity from both the political class and the professions connected to urban design. Planners, architects and landscape architects must show the community how new forms of development and increased density can make&#160;a better city, not just a more crowded city.&#160;And where there are sensible opportunities for increased suburban expansion, then it is incumbent upon planners, architects and landscape architects to create innovative suburbs. Suburbia can remain a viable form&#160;of urbanism if its components are creatively adapted to twenty-first-century challenges. Business as usual is untenable.</p><p>Australian cities have good opportunities for densification. For example, in our book Boomtown 2050: Scenarios for a Rapidly Growing City we showed how Perth could easily double its population in a beneficial manner. Similarly, Professors Rob Adams and Kim Dovey in Melbourne have proven that most of Melbourne\u2019s future growth could be absorbed by infill development along that city\u2019s main arterial roads. When we apply this infill concept to all the nation\u2019s capital cities and major regional centres, we calculate that eighteen million people could be accommodated (Figure 2). In other words, Australian cities do not need to sprawl any further, providing of course that Australians will accept living in apartments along major transport corridors.</p><p>Increasing density along transport corridors seems like a sensible idea but these environments are hardly desirable places to live. If we\u2019ve learnt one thing from the twentieth century it is that we should add density, particularly in the case of low-cost housing, where we have good amenity. Good amenity means more than just proximity to public transport. The unique amenity of each Australian city should be identified and then creative solutions developed as to how more people can live close to that amenity. It is hard, however, to imagine that all of Australia\u2019s existing capital cities and regional centres can absorb an extra twenty to thirty million people. Certainly no politician in their right mind is going to say they should. So what to do? Along with partially increasing the density of our existing urban areas, we should also look for opportune places for entirely new settlements (Figure 3). Landscape architecture can play a major role in this. For starters, a new city, or cities, in the north-west of Australia is a compelling idea. So too is a mosaic of new towns on already cleared land throughout the six-hundred-kilometre-long Swan Coastal Plain north and south of Perth (Figure 3, Figure 4).</p><p>Similarly, there is surely scope for new settlements along a rapid transportation corridor linking Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and even across to Tasmania. An ageing population might migrate north to a new belt of development between Cairns and Mackay. Could Alice Springs sustain a larger population?</p><p>And we don\u2019t mean just bulldozing our way forward \u2013 those days are over. We mean well-designed urbanism based on innovative technologies that are adapted to our fragile landscape and the environmental limits of the twenty-first century. New and existing cities need to be re-imagined as metabolic, not mechanistic. In this regard Australia\u2019s predicted growth is, more than anything, a creative design challenge. If landscape architects don\u2019t apprehend this moment in time, then others less qualified to do so will.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Examining the relationship between photography and architecture, the Emerging Landscapes conference brought together a variety of disciplines.</p><p>The emerging Landscapes conference was a joint venture between the School of Architecture and the Built Environment and the School of Media, Arts and Design at the University of Westminster, held alongside the London Festival of Architecture. It was an international and interdisciplinary conference attended by nearly 150 people.</p><p>The conference theme posited that in the last thirty years we have \u201cwitnessed social, geopolitical, technological and economic change on a global scale [and that over this time] landscape has changed its nature.\u201d Emerging Landscapes sought to examine \u201cthe synergies between the disciplines of photography and architecture\u201d to \u201ccritically reassess the interface between production and representation in the creation of contemporary landscape.\u201d<sup>1</sup></p><p>The theme was explored through a wide range of topics including, but not limited to, contested landscapes, the everyday, non-places, digital technology and new media, changing concepts of nature, landscape, the body and the senses, memorializing landscapes and landscape and narrative. The conference also included presentations from, and attendance by, practitioners, writers, critics, artists and those working in the built environment.<sup>2</sup></p><p>The conference, held over two and a half days, combined seven parallel sessions and several keynote addresses. The broad program included contributions from seven Australian academics in the fields of fine art, art theory, photography, architecture and landscape architecture from Queensland University of Technology, Griffith University, the University of Canberra, Monash University, La Trobe University and the University of Melbourne. There were presentations by landscape academics Gini Lee, Nicole Porter and Jillian Walliss.</p><p>The first keynote address and public lecture was by architect and photographer Gabriele Basilico, who discussed his fascination with the city, its \u201cstrange beauty,\u201d and the void of the urban landscape through his extensive photography of Milanese industrial areas, French landscapes and Beirut at the end of the Lebanese Civil War. While Basilico\u2019s images were beautiful and he spoke with great passion, I was, in the end, as for much of the conference, left wondering how, to paraphrase Gini Lee, \u201cthe use of the photographic record [might] contribute to the possible reconstruction of the city?\u201d</p><p>The address was followed by a reception and the launch of Visual Planning and the Picturesque by Nikolaus Pevsner and marked the opening of the University of Westminster exhibition, Land Architecture People, \u201cintended to dispel some of the mystique around the architectural design process.\u201d<sup>3</sup></p><p>In Making Strange in Urban Landscape Photography, one of the more engaging parallel sessions I attended, Alexandra Stara in Photography and Spaces of Capital looked at the work of Steffi Klenz and Thomas Weinberger. Klenz\u2019s banal and uncanny work Nonsuch features the town of Poundbury, built according to the design principles of Prince Charles on land owned by him.<sup>4</sup> Nonsuch generated much discussion, with the suggestion that through the absence of the figure, Klenz\u2019s \u201cdenial of action,\u201d there might be an implicit critique of Poundbury\u2019s urban design and the people who choose to live there.</p><p>Other compelling presentations focusing on landscape production included Andy Clayden\u2019s Emerging Natural Deathscapes, Cemetery, and Landscape Consumption, Fiona MacLaren\u2019s Memorial Landscapes: Space, Memory, Representation and Elissa Rosenberg\u2019s On Site and Memory: Walking as a Commemorative Practice.</p><p>In the most memorable keynote lecture, The Margins of Vision, Christophe Girot proposed that landscape has become marginalized and that along with the rise of mechanized transport, a general visual disinterest in landscape has developed. For Girot, landscape, as a spatial entity, is no longer of central importance. It has become an \u201cinformal background medium.\u201d Girot is the professor and chair of landscape architecture at ETH Zurich. He presented through student videos, used as \u201cnotation systems,\u201d \u201cthe perception of contemporary landscapes in movement,\u201d images of our time. For Girot \u201clandscape has been relegated to the margins of our vision not only because the ways of viewing our world have changed, but because the thing out there no longer matches the preconceptions we have in our memory.\u201d He argued strongly that there is \u201ca blatant absence of contemporary mythical embodiment\u201d of landscape and that \u201cwhat we presently see is simply not what we get.\u201d</p><p>One of the ambitions of the conference was to facilitate multidisciplinary engagement. While both the speakers and attendees were from a broad range of disciplines, overall there was a lack of facilitated interdisciplinary discussion. As a designer, I found the conference rather frustrating. I felt that the emphasis on photography, while suggesting ways we might reconsider ideas of landscape, did not rigorously interrogate how new understandings of landscape representation might better inform landscape production.</p><p>Perhaps the largest missed opportunity of the conference was that we as the creators of the image of space, and designers of the experience of space, failed to respond to Girot\u2019s polemic that landscape needs a contemporary myth. Had we been able to generate that type of discussion, the conference might have been truly projective.</p><h6>1 University of Westminster, \u201cOutline,\u201d on the Emerging Landscapes website, http://www.emerginglandscapes.org.uk<br />2 University of Westminster, \u201cCall for Papers,\u201d on the Emerging Landscapes website, http://www. emerginglandscapes.org.uk<br />3 University of Westminster, \u201cLand Architecture People Exhibition,\u201d on the University of Westminster website, http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/<br />architecture/news-and-events2/events2/2010/ land-architecture- people-exhibition<br />4 Duchy of Cornwall, \u201cDesign &amp; Development,\u201d on the Duchy of Cornwall website, http://www. duchyofcornwall.org/ designanddevelopment_poundbury.htm<br />5 From James McArdle\u2019s conference presentation \u201cGyration: being in space\u201d.

            "content": "<p>Canberra provided a typically brisk winter weekend in July when the 2010 AILA National Awards Jury gathered to assess this year\u2019s array of submissions from around the country. Ahead of this meeting, we individually reviewed the sixty-six entries, which had been electronically submitted and assembled for us by the national office.&#160;</p><p>All the projects had previously established their credentials through a state awards system, some earning accolades in that process. The seven-member jury undertook the task with fresh eyes, bringing to the table their initial impressions of the national significance of the projects and then entering into robust discussion to eventually arrive at a consensus on the twenty awards made across five categories.</p><p>In the period between the call for submissions and the date of the jury\u2019s deliberations, a new award category for Urban Design was announced by National Council. Consequently, one of the jury\u2019s first tasks was to define what we considered to be an urban design project. We were then at liberty to decide which projects should most appropriately be considered in the Urban Design category. Under the guidelines for the National Awards process, the jury is allowed to move projects between categories if they believe it results in a better \u201cfit\u201d and particularly if it will advantage a project to be considered in a different grouping.</p><p>Most of the projects submitted in the Design category this year were located in urban settings, and of those the jury selected several which we agreed could be identified as urban design projects. The criteria applied in making this selection were that the projects were to be:</p><p>\u2022 designed and constructed; that is, we did not include projects that generated urban design strategies, such as masterplans or guidelines;</p><p>\u2022 situated in the public domain, generating new connections or repairing disconnections between built and/or natural systems on an urban scale;</p><p>\u2022 perceived as having a significant social impact beyond the specific activities provided within a site; and</p><p>\u2022 multi-disciplinary, encompassing landscape architecture, architecture, art, planning and heritage,&#160;realized through a close collaboration between the landscape architects and other relevant disciplines.</p><p>These criteria aimed to distinguish urban design projects within the context of landscape architectural practice, and we anticipate they will generate discussion and perhaps some difference of opinion. The projects awarded in this new category vary considerably, ranging in scale and context, but the jury considered that each met the four criteria. With the Urban Design category now included in the national program, the state awards programs will now add this category to their programs. Through the process of deliberation at the State level, we look forward to a continued refinement of the category\u2019s definition.</p><p>Having come to an agreement on the new award category, the jury then discussed what would be considered an exemplary award-winning project. We agreed that we were looking for \u201chigh distinction\u201d work, innovative projects that set new benchmarks and solutions that extended beyond \u201cbest practice.\u201d As would be expected in a national awards program, there was a great diversity of project types, scales, budgets and contexts. We gave careful thought to recognizing the special factors inherent in each project, and appreciated the attention given in the submissions to explaining how the project addressed the Australian Landscape Principles and reflected environmental responsibility and sustainability. In a number of the projects, we recognized that social sustainability was a central concern, equal in significance to environmental/ecological sustainability. Overall, the jury was impressed with the high level of creativity and design thinking demonstrated in the projects and we were struck by the increasing capacity of landscape architects to undertake and often lead highly complex projects.</p><p>I would like to acknowledge and thank my fellow jury members, who were thoroughly dedicated to the task, equitable and collegial in their approach, which is not to say that we agreed on every point. But in the end, we were able to reach consensus on the final selections. In particular, we benefited from the astute contribution of Gary Rake from the National Capital Authority, a frequent client of landscape architectural services who was particularly valuable in providing an informed non-landscape architect\u2019s view of the project work. Many thanks also to Paul Costigan, AILA\u2019s executive director, and his team for providing a well-organized structure that allowed us to do our job efficiently.</p><p>Congratulations to all those who submitted their work for consideration in this year\u2019s awards program. It was a privilege to review the excellent work undertaken by colleagues around the country and overseas. On behalf of the jury, I commend this work to readers and encourage a continued discussion about how the AILA National Awards program can be an effective means of acknowledging Australian landscape architects\u2019 outstanding professional achievements \u2013 to each other, to other professions and to the public at large.</p>",

The site has evolved over a period of 140 years, hosting a number of disparate uses, including twenty years as a water supply reservoir, the original use, through to council depot and workshop, petrol station and more recently a simple grassed public park. With the collapse of the roof structure in 1991, the site was closed to public access. The decision not to simply cap off the site and make another grassed lawn triggered an opportunity to explore the possibilities of revealing and working with the ruins. The result is this engaging, multi-layered urban space that allows visitors to move through and among the spaces and be immersed in the heritage of the reservoir.</p><p>The jury admired the rich interplay of elements \u2013 built and natural \u2013 that express and interpret the site\u2019s diverse heritage, conserving it for contemporary use and for use by future generations. The success of the project clearly results from a close, collaborative and integrated design process between JMD Design and architects Tonkin Zulaikha Greer, working with the City of Sydney. From a landscape architecture perspective, the jury appreciated the sensitively selected material palette for structural elements and the clarity of the three planting zones of the gardens: ranging from the rooftop garden to the two \u201crooms\u201d of the sunken garden and the street-level edge that connects to the Paddington urban precinct.</p><p>This is clearly an exceptional and superbly realized project of outstanding merit. The jury was unanimous in awarding it the Medal for Landscape Architecture for 2010.</p>",

With these moves, the designers were able to re-establish locally significant vistas and axes, shifting the visual and physical access into and throughout the park and setting up new patterns of movement and social interaction.</p><p>This is surely what urban design is about.

            "content": "<p>Although August was a time of political uncertainty, at least the announcement of the 2010 AILA National Awards afforded us some professional clarity. The importance of the AILA National Awards goes beyond just acknowledging exemplary work. They provide a window into where the profession is going in terms of development trends and new innovations, as well as setting the benchmark of how we are currently defining good design in Australia.</p><p>This year, the jury had a formidable task of assessing sixty-six entries from across the country: New South Wales (eighteen), Victoria (eighteen), Queensland (eleven), Western Australia (eleven), South Australia (five), the Australian Capital Territory (two) and the Northern Territory (one). <br />From these, twenty were selected for awards \u2013 exactly half of these went to practices in New South Wales (ten), with the remaining to Victoria (four), Queensland (three), and Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory each earning one.</p><p>What is most striking about the 2010 submissions is their focus on sustainability issues. Part of this can be attributed to the new entry requirement of justifying projects against the AILA Landscape Principles. However, juror Jennie Curtis believed it reflected a paradigm shift in how designers are now approaching projects: \u201cAspects of environmentally sensitive design, which were seen as new and innovative just two or three years ago, have now become just a matter of course.\u201d Influencing this shift are clients, who increasingly require practices to demonstrate sustainable design initiatives as part of the tendering process.</p><p>In a country known for its coastline, it\u2019s not surprising that many of the award submissions focused on waterfront redevelopment. What\u2019s encouraging is that we\u2019re doing it well, with nine of the twenty winning entries proposing designs that engage with the water\u2019s edge. It\u2019s reaffirming to see that city governments and developers are recognizing the value of our waterfronts and increasingly involve landscape architects in their reclamation as important public spaces.</p><p>We\u2019re also making headway in embracing Australian history. Although it\u2019s a relatively young country, designers are finding ways of using our cultural heritage to underpin site design concepts. Many projects demonstrated an appreciation of previous uses and materials through design moves that accentuated site histories. Practices are also continuing to find ways of promoting social sustainability through creative engagement with communities, whether in designing spaces for specific groups or providing guidance in imagining town futures.</p><p>But the awards also reveal some glaring gaps. For instance, the 2010 awards were missing bread-and-butter projects such as small-scale residential, subdivision development and shopping centre retrofits. Urban Design winner Rouse Hill Town Centre demonstrates that the work is being done (and in this case, incredibly well). But where were all the other examples? Perhaps practices don\u2019t think the work qualifies under the Landscape Principles. Or that they are not as \u201csexy\u201d as bigger projects. But they are some of the most common, which makes them just as important. Does their absence signal apathy in terms of their design? Or is it a limitation of the award criteria?</p><p>We\u2019re beginning to take a greater interest in compiling data about the spaces we create \u2013 both scientific and social. We\u2019re also starting to get better at standardizing and distributing this information. But based on the small number of projects that dribble in for the Research and Communication category, we can do better. On a day-to-day basis, practices are often exploring new materials, testing construction techniques, investigating methods of community engagement or assessing the latest representation technology. But rarely is this information compiled and circulated within the design community, let alone to the general public. If we are to advance as a profession \u2013 and within the design industry \u2013 we need to find ways of promoting the work that we do. Investing more time in research and its communication is one way of accomplishing this.</p><p>Of course, there is always the possibility that practices are choosing not to submit projects to the national awards. Out of approximately three hundred AILA-registered practices across the country, thirty-two participated in the national awards this year. That\u2019s roughly 10 percent. In contrast, the 2008 AILA National Awards had ninety-six entries \u2013 that\u2019s 30 percent more than this year. This raises many questions: are the awards capturing a fair representation of projects and firms? And if not, then why not? Was the introduction of the Landscape Principles into this year\u2019s entry requirements too prescriptive for submissions? Or are the categories themselves off the mark? If the awards are trying to capture a bigger, more diverse applicant pool, should they be defined more by budget or project area, as done by some of our international counterparts?</p><p>Perhaps for an AILA-registered practice, entering one project into the national awards should be compulsory \u2013 like voting. Sure, it would require time, but it would provide some important professional introspection \u2026 and who knows, maybe even a prize.</p>",

            "content": "<p>The recent and successful AILA National Awards program reminds us not only of the diversity in practice of landscape architecture in Australia, but also of its increasingly regional expression. The number of realized landscape architecture projects provides us with an ever-expanding critical mass that defines and promotes our profession.</p>\r\n<p>Our visibility has traditionally suffered from an absence of this critical mass which comprises not only award-winning projects, but other forms of practice less likely to catch the public eye. Both categories are of interest, and these &ldquo;other forms of practice&rdquo; can be just as important to us as a profession. Wherever we can, we should aim to extend the margins of landscape architecture, encouraging recognition of landscape architects who practise in the academic, public and private spheres. Each seems to enrich the other and our practice is more difficult without the contribution each makes.</p>\r\n<p>What is obvious in these awards is the emergence of an Australian style in landscape architecture. This is an approach that is most comfortable when we are able to &ldquo;feel the breeze, hear the rain, see the landscape, smell the dryness&rdquo; &ndash; in other words, design work that responds to a genius loci that is wholly Australian. These projects sit lightly on the land, celebrating their engagement with and respect of the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; landscape. As a profession, we have been particularly successful in translating this style to an urban context &ndash; take the winning Ballast Park project on Sydney Harbour and the Paddington Reservoir Gardens. I cannot imagine these projects being anywhere other than where they are. They represent much of what is healthy in the landscape architecture profession in Australia.</p>\r\n<p>This year&rsquo;s awards unashamedly celebrate the urban &ndash; nine out of the twenty awards are located in metropolitan Sydney. This continues the dominance of urban design projects in our major capital cities &ndash; a retrospective of the AILA awards program over the last ten years reveals the dominance of similar types of projects for public clients. These projects invariably result from collaboration, including involvement with public sector managers as active participants in the process of design and procurement. This dominance is evident both in the number of awarded projects and also in their visibility outside of our profession.</p>\r\n<p>On the one hand, the celebration by awards of these visible urban projects does much to promote our profession; for example, most Australians are aware of our most public urban projects. By operating in the public realm, landscape architecture increases the visibility of both the profession and the landscape functionality of our cities. On the other hand, some of the quirky, interesting (from a design viewpoint) and socially and environmentally relevant projects seem overpowered by these urban heavyweights.</p>\r\n<p>The urban public realm continues to provide a focus for work by landscape architects. Indeed, some argue that the public realm has provided the setting for the majority of interesting design work to have emerged in Australia &ndash; work that concentrates on place-making, the melding of physical space with people so that places have cultural relevance and meaning. These projects are well designed and executed, and are equivalent to the best found internationally.</p>\r\n<p>To find award-winning landscape architectural projects for private clients is much more difficult (in this awards program, the Nungatta Station is a refreshing exception). Even more noticeable, however, is the absence of recognition for projects less in the public eye but significant to the core values which we as a profession espouse. Almost in contrast to the way landscape architecture has dominated urban design is our absence in the wider environmental debate that includes the health and continued productivity of the Australian landscape.</p>\r\n<p>As a society, we cannot underestimate the emergence of environmentalism and the ethic of sustainable design.Sustainability is one of the powerful and compelling narratives within landscape architecture. There are other equally powerful narratives at work, such as the act of &ldquo;healing&rdquo; the landscape &ndash; transforming social and natural space to new cultural and biophysical forms.</p>\r\n<p>These awards show that we are no longer tied by an attachment to the picturesque or the kind of philosophically impoverished debates centred on arguments of beauty in the landscape. As if we cannot have both. Our concern is about establishing an ongoing relationship with the landscape through the process of design. Invariably this design process is complex, requiring interdisciplinary cooperation and an understanding of what to retain, transform or replace. It is focused on the history of a site and its natural and social ecology.</p>\r\n<p>Landscape architecture has developed the artistic and technical tools to create imaginative spaces that also address complex social and environmental demands. If the winning projects in this year&rsquo;s awards are typical, the narrative power of contemporary landscape architecture is clear. The relevance and importance of landscape architecture is now not questioned, only our willingness to push our now accepted paradigms to new levels of relevance.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>International ideas competition Sea Change 2030+ has awarded three joint winners, each providing innovative management solutions to sea level rise in Sydney.</strong></p><p>Just south of the interpretive paving&#160;that marks the former shoreline of the harbour, Sydney\u2019s Customs House was the venue for the exhibition and announcement of winners of&#160;the AILA\u2019s Sea Change 2030+ competition.&#160;The competition called for early adaptation proposals for the predicted rise in sea levels in the harbour. Sea Change 2030+ was the latest&#160;of a string of international competitions and research projects addressing sea level rise and particularly its effects on human occupation&#160;of coastal land.</p><p>The jury was an experienced group of academics, practitioners and critics, consisting of Allen Kearns, Robert Schaefer, Penny Allan, Sacha Coles, Adrian McGregor, Mark Conlon, Norma Shankie-Williams and David Martin. Rather than awarding an overall winner from the professional pool of fourteen entries, the jury selected three joint-winners: Sea-Life, Subtropical Sydney and the Embassy of Drowned Nations. Schemes were chosen that tackled the issues of sea level rise relating to different scales of change. Together, the winners covered local, metropolitan and global propositions. The shared outcome was, in part, the product of a brief that asked for a project of any scale, on a site chosen by the participant, making conclusive comparisons difficult. Nevertheless, by issuing such a broad brief, the competition successfully brought to the surface the complexity of the terrain and encouraged submissions beyond the technocratic.</p><p>Sea-Life, an entry by NMGS, a team from Australia and Chile, took a small-scale approach. The proposal focused on maintaining the recreational swimming activities of Sydney\u2019s beaches. The team undertook a typological analysis of some of Sydney Harbour\u2019s edge conditions popular with swimmers and suggested technical solutions to foreseeable problems. The focus remained on recreational use, yet some of the measures employed could also be configured to sustain essential ecosystem habitats. Micro strategies proposed were incremental and agile enough to shift alongside future macro scale revisions of sea level projections. Within the unknown spectrum of time verses rise, the team drafted the beginnings of some incremental adjustments to the iconic Balmoral Beach. Sand nourishment from tidal drifts, artificial reef construction and selective softening or hardening of sea wall profiles were some of the fairly typical strategies employed. The most interesting part of this project was its proposition for near-shore parks and streetscapes to shift program with the beach as the sandy strips become lost to the sea. In this way, the project offered a sense of the opportunities for a new landscape typology of elevated and flexible harbour parks. The submission stopped short of a detailed design proposal but exposed a contextual nuance that could result from sea level rise.</p><p>At a metropolitan level, Subtropical Sydney, by American team Opsys, took a spatially broader approach than the Sea-Life submission. This entry identified part of Botany Bay as its major site. The selection of site alone made this a very strong proposal. Botany Bay was the original site of European arrival and the city has since turned its back on the sandy soils in favour of the sandstone drama of Sydney Harbour. Botany Bay has been the infrastructure dumping ground ever since, from factories to the recent desalination plant. The giant heap of airports has been part of this backyard dump, yet it has transformed Botany Bay once again into Sydney\u2019s international front door. The urban extension of Sydney back into this area; including projects such as Victoria Park, Zetland and Green Square, has contained the first true attempts at constructed ecologies. These will become part of the essential patched mosaic overlaying natural systems that have been largely interrupted or destroyed. For a team from abroad to select the airport site is insightful. Their proposal included remodelling the fill of Sydney Airport to help the structure act as an inter-tidal interface. It also proposed a tidal management system of sorts along the Alexandra Canal and urban food production to support the city. Whether the entrants were conscious of it or not, this proposal is far more realistic than the obligatory urban agriculture proposed in most \u201csustainable\u201d urban schemes. The sandy soils and long history of Chinese market gardens in the area give the proposal great potential. Urban water management is key to the survival of near-shore ecosystems threatened by sea level rise. If only this scheme had been woven with south Sydney\u2019s existing water sensitive design agenda, the competition may have had a clear winner.</p><p>The third joint winner was the Embassy of Drowned Nations project by Oculus Sydney. This project placed Sydney in the global scene as a city that will, in fact, suffer fairly minimal human impact as a result of sea level rise. The project\u2019s anthropocentric position obscured the city\u2019s very real ecological dilemmas, yet it touched on another problem. On a global scale, managed retreat is the only real answer that may satisfactorily allow near-shore ecosystems to adapt slowly to changing edges. However, overlaid with the expensive near-shore real estate grids as Sydney is, there is little likelihood of residents allowing their million-dollar land to change from sun lounges to salt marshes. In wealthy cities, the pressure to move will come from property insurance companies before it comes from the sea. Premium Change 2030+ may have been a more apt proposition for many of Sydney\u2019s harbourside areas. Cities where land values are very high will have more incentive to hold back the sea than to retreat as it rises. The Thames estuary protection barrier is an example of a billion-dollar temporary structure paid for with taxpayer money that still became a justifiably minor expense to protect the many billions of dollars-worth of insured real estate in central London. In the wealthy city, essential near-shore ecosystems will be at greater risk than human lives. The Oculus scheme proposed that some of the tens of millions of people who cannot afford not to retreat from the sea are brought to a kind of offshore processing facility set up around Fort Denison. The submission succeeded in drawing attention to the tragic plight of the already drowning parts of the world, where lives are truly at stake, and proposed a centre for climate change research as emblematic of the times as the Opera House or Harbour Bridge. However, it also inadvertently created a typically Australian solution for refugees to \u201clearn and to eventually rise up and join Australian society.\u201d What better place than a constructed island to educate newcomers to Sydney about the cultural importance of a sparkling harbour view, before shifting them out west?</p><p>Another noteworthy submission, although not selected as a winner, was the entry by Dr Julian Bolleter and Professor Richard Weller. This team took a long leap back from technical propositions. Their contribution was a suite of digitally doctored images based on the series of paintings titled The Course of Empire originally created by Thomas Cole between 1833 and 1836. The violent imagery placed environmental disaster as the downfall of Sydney\u2019s \u201cempire\u201d and made the wonderful \u201csecret hideout tubes\u201d proposed by winning Year 2 school student Jack Holt feel like essential infrastructure. Their approach was engaging as it put the thinking underpinning the competition into the contexts of both time and human nature. The scheme suggested through its rhetorical adaptations that there are potentials in complex constructed ecologies, but also required will be a cataclysmic storm surge that leaves us with little choice but to understand our place in the whole. Humankind appears to have come full circle as our unpredictable environment once again becomes a threat, a great fearful, natural unknown. Did we learn anything from the last two centuries? In Sydney the answers may depend on postcode. Ideas competitions of this nature make essential contributions to a global debate. The AILA has provided a stage&#160;for a dense, visual conversation between government, professionals and even schoolchildren in this competition and this is a most valuable and timely contribution.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Various lessons have been learnt from Sea Change 2030+ as a pilot project, which highlight the potential obstacles and opportunities of taking adaptation thinking into mainstream practice.</strong></p><p>Sea Change 2030+ was conceived in early 2009 as a \u201cpilot project\u201d for exploring innovative and positive climate futures through the lens of adaptation, with a focus on Australian coastal urban settlement.</p><p>The competition aimed to actively&#160;engage in direct dialogue about climate change adaptation between AILA members and the wider community by establishing a broad platform of support linking three levels of government: industry, education sectors and built environment design professions. It also aimed to \u201cmainstream\u201d the concept of sustainable urban development within a low-carbon future and engage the wider community in shared explorations of what abstract concepts such as \u201cresilience\u201d and \u201cadaptation\u201d to climate change might look like.Rather than requiring contestants to grapple with a complex set of climate change impacts, the competition was framed around testing responses to a single climate change impact \u2013 sea level rise (SLR) in a single urban locale, Sydney Harbour.</p><p>As an \u201ciconic maritime place\u201d Sydney Harbour was selected due to its vulnerability to climate change, its intrinsic value and high engagement potential. Sydney\u2019s harbour foreshores also represent one of the world\u2019s largest bodies of professional work by landscape architects in urban waterfront revitalization and rehabilitation, with over forty years of built projects \u2013 areas that will be among the first impacted by SLR. Through the process of organizing an international ideas competition with a broad platform of support and reflection on the outcomes, we take the opportunity to share some of our key findings.</p><p>Our competition partners encouraged us to offer contestants the freedom to \u201cdefine their own projects\u201d across a potentially broad mosaic of built and/or natural environments. In this regard, Sydney Harbour offered many rich possibilities for exploring innovation in climate change adaptation planning and design.</p><p>Lesson 1: Consider the scale and time frame of your adaptation proposal and the range of stakeholders \u2013 it may vary from simple to complex depending on the project footprint and longevity.</p><p>While the competition brief was developed during the frenzied period leading up to the COP15 Conference in Copenhagen (when there was often hysterical media coverage of SLR projections exceeding six metres), AILA adopted the New South Wales Government SLR policy released in November 2009. As pictured by Simon Smith, deputy director general of the New South Wales Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW), this policy forecasts a much less dramatic SLR increase of \u201cknee high by 2050 (forty centimetres) and waist high (ninety centimetres) by 2100.\u201d</p><p>As an agreed starting point, the committee then assembled a complex data set at a bio-regional/landscape systems level \u2013 Sydney Harbour and its total urban catchment. We quickly found that this type of integrated information is not held by any one public authority and is very time consuming to assemble. (DECCW is now working on collation of climate impact data on an urban grid of 10 km x 10 km and a statewide grid of 30 km x 30 km to address this issue.)</p><p>Lesson 2: Public agencies need to develop a coordinated \u201cone-stop shop\u201d of climate impact and base data. Adaptation projects will potentially involve many separate requests to public agencies for information that some are reluctant to provide.</p><p>Constructing a \u201cworld first\u201d in urban SLR ideas competitions, and going further than the 2009 San Francisco Rising Tides competition, our partners were keen to invite submissions from primary and secondary schools, NGOs and community groups. This can require significant coordination and working in unchartered professional territory with new partners.</p><p>Lesson 3: Learn to facilitate. Projects will become a good place to start many of the cross-professional, inter-agency and community conversations landscape architects will become involved in as we adapt to climate change.</p><p>Submissions were received from Europe, the USA, South America and across Australia from over eighty contestants, often working in large teams. Submissions received from primary and secondary schools were perhaps the most transformative and insightful. They utilized drawings and poetry and injected a sense of humour, adventure and fun into the competition.</p><p>Lesson 4: Engage with future generations as they will surprise you with their perceptions on climate change \u2013 they often see exciting opportunities where others only see risks, problems and constraints.</p><p>The competition generated mainstream media coverage but perhaps not as much as we had all hoped for, despite our best efforts at cultivating radio, television and print media. Community engagement, knowledge sharing and professional capacity building were key objectives for the competition. We now aim to co-publish the outcomes and exhibit entries to further increase the profile of landscape architects as \u201cearly adaptation experts.\u201d</p><p>Lesson 5: Develop a strategy to effectively communicate adaptation ideas to stakeholders and intensify media engagement.</p><p>The experience of Sea Change 2030+ has provided many valuable insights into the need for \u201ccapacity building\u201d in Australian landscape architecture. As a pilot project, the competition process has highlighted some potential obstacles in the application of adaptation thinking into mainstream professional practice.</p><p>Importantly, the competition also provided a spotlight on the many new opportunities that will arise from adapting urban places to climate change and building resilience armed with an expanded professional tool kit.</p><p>AILA\u2019s Climate Change Adaptation Skills for Professionals (CCASP) program has been in development since 2008 and is now being rolled out by state groups. This research and education policy work was funded by the federal government and managed by AILA in partnership with the CSIRO Climate Adaptation National Research Flagship, who was also a key advisor to the competition. It\u2019s perhaps fitting then that final words (and perhaps lesson 6) come from competition jury chair Allen Kearns. \u201cThe ideas competition also highlights a niche for systematic innovation at a regional scale. The \u2018design mind\u2019 brings insights that are not currently being generated by science analysis and synthesis nor planning systems. The \u2018science meets design\u2019 opportunity was made clear to me when looking at the entries. I could easily see the value and significance in the way that visualization becomes a much more powerful form of communication than written scientific descriptions of climate vulnerability.\u201d</p>",

My son Brett was photographing the ceremony and building works and encouraged me to be there. Thousands of us marched up Anzac Parade to the memorial, which is prominently located near the entrance of the main building. The retired General Peter Cosgrove spoke movingly during the dedication ceremony about our service and I felt enormously proud to have been a part of the whole Nasho scheme. After all the groups of families and friends had dispersed, I had the chance for some quiet reflection with smaller groups near the memorial's centrepiece.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The quiet sound of the running water, the flat surfaces covered in wreaths and the three emblems of our defence services strategically placed around the overflowing bowl create a peaceful place, allowing a flood of memories to return \u2013 those who died during their service, those who have died since and close friends whom I still have fifty-four years later. The Nashos, our families, their children and all Australians can at last be reminded very publicly of our contribution. As a national serviceman, I wish to express my thanks to all concerned for the decision to create this place and its excellent design and execution.\u201d</p><p>Mervyn William Boardman, &#160;<span class=\"new-grey\">A220079 RAAF. Point Cook Victoria.</span></p></blockquote><p>War memorials address subjects of&#160;great gravitas and the design of the National Service Memorial and Courtyard, the central feature of the Eastern Precinct, respectfully responds to these themes with subtlety, sensitivity and strength.</p><p>According to historian Ken Inglis, it is only in the last two centuries of human history that memorials have represented the human cost of war with the eloquence previously reserved for celebrating victory. Previously, regular soldiers were \u201cburied anonymously, mere compost for the cause which they willingly or unwillingly served.\u201d<sup>1</sup> Contemporary memorials like this one commemorate the efforts of ordinary people who serve in war, creating a space to remember, acknowledge, celebrate, mourn and reflect. The formal courtyard and fountain are dedicated to all Australian National Servicemen (over 290,000 in total) and in memory of those who died. National servicemen were conscripted between 1951 and 1972, including some who served in <br />the Vietnam War.</p><p>This memorial represents the wishes of veterans themselves. The idea of a memorial fountain originated with the National Servicemen\u2019s Association of Australia. The Association worked closely with the Australian War Memorial (AWM), raising funds, consulting stakeholders and providing advice on the design. Significantly, Johnson Pilton Walker\u2019s (JPW) design was approved by National Service associations throughout Australia. Few changes to the original design were requested, an indication that early consultation and a clear brief enabled the designers to create an appropriate response.</p><p>The National Service Memorial and Courtyard is tucked immediately east of the main war memorial building, transforming an area formerly used for bus parking and circulation. The formal courtyard consists of a symmetrical cruciform arrangement of paving, seating and grass areas leading to a low memorial fountain.</p><p>The treatment of this space is deceptively simple and precise. As with the rest of its AWM work, JPW merges architecture and landscape, detail and context, practical needs and abstract symbolism. Proportion, geometry and materiality are all carefully chosen in response to site context, pragmatic needs and symbolic function.</p><p>The courtyard seeks to function as an intimate space for quiet, individual reflection as well as a ceremonial space for commemorative events \u2013 for example, the dedication ceremony, attended by over 3,000 people. To achieve this flexibility, the space has a double enclosure: the whole courtyard area is bounded by box hedges on three sides at human height and an inner row of low hedges and seating surrounds the fountain at its centre. These proportions and repeated geometries mediate between the imposing backdrop of the existing memorial building, the adjacent open space of the new cafe, the gravel forecourt on the other side&#160;and the relatively modest size of the fountain itself. The formal geometry is consistent with the architecture surrounding it, successfully linking the new memorial to its context. Three asymmetrically sited trees (Eucalyptus pauciflora) give relief to this formality and tie the courtyard to its broader landscape setting of nearby eucalyptus lawns and the backdrop of Mount Ainslie. Materials have been selected to be in sympathy with the context too, with bronze, sandstone, granite and pencil pines all referencing existing architecture and memorials on site.</p><p>The centrepiece fountain uses an uncluttered geometry of triangle, circle and square, so iconic it has been used as the image for a commemorative fifty cent coin. The high quality and attention to detail evident here befit the site and setting (especially since its integrated design merges object and space). From a distance, the fountain sits quietly at the centre of the courtyard: low, heavy, solid, human scale. As one approaches, the sound of the water intensifies, spilling over from a bronze vessel into the polished granite base on which it appears to float. Water wells up invisibly from within and overflows, a slow, constant source pushing to the surface and emptying away in a forceful gravitational cascade. The water flow has been visually and acoustically perfected: a bronze bead was prototyped and refined to achieve a stream of water at the exact desired angle, the volume of water and a hidden echo chamber of granite designed to create the right acoustic environment. Computerized operation allows for the adjustment of water levels as needed. On a practical level, the fountain uses recycled water and has been designed to remain attractive even if water restrictions make it necessary to have no water flow at all.</p><p>This memorial shies away from directly confronting or challenging Australia\u2019s national service policies, but it nevertheless makes a powerful gesture of commemoration which can be read in different ways. There is no explicit postmodern ambiguity or spatial complexity, no triumphant statuary (the national servicemen did not want this) or even names to emotively humanize the space. Yet in spite of this \u2013 or perhaps because of it \u2013 the space invites subjective interpretation and contemplation of its meaning. According to JPW, the tripartite use of materials and geometries symbolizes navy/army/air force and water/stone/sky respectively. To me the courtyard and its overflowing anti-heroic fountain have a pathos, an almost apologetic feel. I couldn\u2019t help thinking of the fate of those people forced to go to war because of a combination of government policy and the random \u201chuman lottery\u201d<sup>2</sup> of their birth date. To veterans or school kids or international visitors it can mean completely different things. The design creates an atmospheric space where multiple interpretations and reflections are possible, a dignified landscape where less can say more.</p><p><strong>Site development&#160;2001\u20132010</strong></p><p>The Eastern Precinct Development at the Australian War Memorial by JPW integrates a range of landscape and architectural elements within a nationally significant heritage landscape. The Eastern Precinct marks the culmination of a comprehensive site development plan first developed in 2001 and reviewed in 2005, which identified three stages of implementation across the AWM site: the Western Precinct, the Parade Ground and the current works. This precinct includes the National Service Memorial and Courtyard, the cafe and forecourt and a new basement car park, as well as restored eucalyptus lawns, coach parking and service spaces.</p><p>The relationships between functional drivers and symbolic power, landscape and architecture, site and context, quality of materials and quality of experience are all well considered. This high quality design resolution can, in part, be attributed to the relationship between designer and client. During the past decade JPW has enjoyed a close and ongoing collaboration with AWM staff. For the client, this meant investing time in the process, as described by Stewart Mitchell, head of Buildings and Services.</p><p>\u201cWe all put a lot of time in (and) we know each other very well. We spent a lot of time just talking about what our expectations were. I never felt like I was just \u2018the client,\u2019 I felt as though I made a real contribution to the design. Because of the ten years of planning, the concept (for the Eastern Precinct) was in everybody\u2019s minds for a long time, so when it came to putting it onto paper we all knew the direction we were heading in.\u201d</p><p>From JPW director Richard Johnson\u2019s perspective, the \u201chuge responsibility\u201d of designing for the needs of this major cultural institution and its extensive group of stakeholders, including veterans, was assisted by the clarity of purpose and leadership shown by AWM management and staff.</p><p>\u201cTo get a good result you need a good client. They have a very clear mission which is very clearly articulated. Management wanted to be involved exploring options and debating,\u201d Richard says.</p><p>This fruitful relationship meant JPW was well placed to resolve the complexities of a project which combined landscape planning and management, architecture and memorial design. They established a landscape strategy and principles which guided individual projects, with the team reviewing and refining the work at each stage. Such shared learning and understanding has resulted in a commemorative landscape which can be managed and maintained as intended, an important consideration if design integrity is to be sustained.</p><p>The robust plan has ensured that cumulative changes have contributed to a broader vision for this landscape \u2013 each of the elements within the precinct is a well-handled piece of design in its own right, and together these form a cohesive and dignified landscape experience. This process also yielded projects which came in on time and under budget.</p><p>One of the most complex elements of the Eastern Precinct, according to the client, was \u201cto get a building (the cafe) which could sit in this place\u201d by being compatible with the scale of the existing memorial building and the landscape setting of eucalyptus lawns as well as the backdrop of Mount Ainslie. JPW responded with a concept requiring major earthworks, including removing a hill, and Johnson praised the client for \u201chaving the bravery to support this design approach and championing the concept when engaging with stakeholders and authorities.\u201d AWM is pleased with the result. Stewart remarks, \u201cWhat is outstanding about the architecture and the landscape is that it looks as if it\u2019s always been here.\u201d</p><p>Overall, the work seamlessly addresses the functional as well as the symbolic demands of the site, illustrating what an interdisciplinary design team and client can achieve when given enough resources (time as well as budget) to achieve a refined result.</p><h6>1 K.S.

            "content": "<p><strong>Nestled behind the Adelaide Zoo, this pedestrian bridge creates an opportunity to engage with and navigate the meandering River Torrens.</strong></p><p>As the first new pedestrian crossing&#160;built over the River Torrens in Adelaide since 1937, the new footbridge by Oxigen provides a vital connection through the bifurcated Adelaide Park Lands and forms part of the extensive network of shared-use paths constituting the Adelaide City Park Lands Trail. Located behind the Adelaide Zoo, this section of the river has long been considered unsavoury and unsafe, despite the somewhat beguiling informal quality of the meandering river, pronounced topography and mature eucalypts, which together contrast with the more manicured embankments further west. While facilitating passage between North Adelaide and the city, and to the adjacent public facilities such as the zoo, Botanic Gardens and Botanic Park, the bridge also allows brief contemplation of this undervalued but idiosyncratic landscape and increases the prominence of the adjacent River Torrens Sculpture Walk.</p><p>In discussing the project, Oxigen speak of their endeavour to respond directly to the specific conditions of the site and function in an exercise of \u201cfitting lines to the landscape.\u201d &#160;This has resulted in careful positioning of&#160;the bridge midway down the embankment to provide isolation from adjacent traffic and respond explicitly to desire lines and predicted&#160;patterns of use for cyclists and pedestrians. Consequently the bridge crossing occurs in&#160;close proximity to the water below. Coupled&#160;with the gently curved inflection in plan, which reflects and encourages dominant traffic flows, this proximity to the water makes apparent the site morphology and promotes a pleasant and intimate engagement with the river.</p><p>The direct response to site and movement is further reinforced by an equally direct formal and material response. Structure is economic but expressive; primary materials are serviceable and varied \u2013 including Corten, stainless and galvanized steel \u2013 and do not require applied finishes, with the exception of the substructure painted silver to provide a sharp contrast to the murky water below. The deck is an innovative composite system of galvanized web-forge steel mesh infilled with granolithic rubber softfall. The outer edges of the deck are left as open mesh, providing a slim and porous edge to allow drainage and views through to the water below. LED strip lighting is incorporated into the balusters in an elegant and integrated fashion.</p><p>Despite its relatively modest scale, the bridge assumes an assertive presence in the landscape and reinforces the role of well-executed urban infrastructure in the production of an engaging, relevant and desirable public realm.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe bridge over the River Torrens&#160;is a key connector for the iconic Adelaide City Park Lands Trail. It provides a critical link between the northern and southern sides&#160;of the River Torrens near the Adelaide Zoo.&#160;The trail itself is a unique and important collaboration of the Adelaide City Council&#160;and state government. It provides approximately twenty-four kilometres of shared-use cycle and pedestrian footpath circumnavigating the Park Lands and providing for both commuting and recreation.</p><p>The bridge is a key component of the wider trail network. This section of the trail provides key recreational links and physical connections for city visitors to the major destinations of the zoo and the Botanic Gardens. This section of the trail and the bridge itself provides an opportunity for people to access and further explore the Adelaide Park Lands, the River Torrens&#160;Linear Park Trail and the broader&#160;regional recreational connections and&#160;open space networks of the adjoining&#160;local government areas.\u201d</p><p>Marty Reeve,&#160;Adelaide City Council.</p></blockquote>",

            "content": "<p><strong>After seven years, this courtyard\u2019s plant life has exploded, in glorious contrast to the rigid steps and surfaces of its setting.</strong></p><p>Back in 2003, the recently completed Centre for Ideas courtyard by Rush\\Wright Associates (RWA) at the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) in South Melbourne won a design commendation at the Victorian AILA awards. The jury was impressed by RWA\u2019s imaginative juxtaposition of everyday materials that referred to and complemented the Minifie Nixon-designed building, with its reflective, metallic, Voronoi tessellated facade surfaces. The Centre for Ideas is not a stand-alone building. Nestled together with pre-existing structures, it presents itself on only two sides, west and north. Consequently, RWA\u2019s courtyard wraps around the centre in an L configuration, surrounded by a lacklustre conglomeration of single-storey brick studios, workshops and police stables, all encamped together in the VCA\u2019s no-man's-land. The centre\u2019s facade, comprising a complex banding of differentiated intersecting prefabricated modular panels, demanded a response from RWA which the AILA jury ultimately vindicated.</p><p>RWA openly acknowledges Keith Critchlow\u2019s influence on their design; in fact, their overall design inclination reveals itself indebted to hard-edge abstraction and 1960s op art precedents. The pavement pairing of white concrete with asphalt in bands across the ground plane has been a predilection of RWA when designing courtyards for educational institutions. Variations on the theme are found at Deakin University, Burwood, and at Victoria University in Footscray. Unlike the Bridget Riley-inspired oscillating groove laid down at Deakin, the VCA courtyard has regular parallel striping. As in these other courtyards, RWA has designed the Centre for Ideas courtyard to be inclusive of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The loading dock alongside the centre\u2019s main entrance is not immediately noticeable but is a reminder that the courtyard is as much about maintaining vehicle accessibility as it is about creating a pleasant environment for pedestrians and students wishing to take a breather to smoke a cigarette between classes. In this context, RWA\u2019s black-and-white stripes evoke memories of school zebra crossings and the awakening of traffic safety awareness in young enquiring minds.</p><p>RWA also has a penchant for seating pods, although at the VCA they hadn\u2019t yet incorporated sitting with their structures' intial function of delineating vehicular and pedestrian space. The four white, roughly textured, hexagonal prefabricated concrete pyramids located outside the centre\u2019s entrance are visually arresting, although their apices are not conducive to sitting on. Instead, a grey, multifaceted concrete seat aligned within the corners of a half polygon is located outside the centre\u2019s entrance. Two other similar seats visible on the concept plan were never realized. The seat on the north side of the loading dock was left out presumably because it impeded vehicle circulation around the corner of the building near the narrowest part of the courtyard.</p><p>The most obvious visual change to the courtyard since its inception is the growth of the river she-oaks (Casuarina cunninghamiana), which have excelled and now fill the space in front of the building. The graceful presence of the she-oaks, with their abundant branchlet litter underneath, enforce a natural contrast to the more rigid polygonal reification of the courtyard steps and surfaces and the metallic machine-generated plating of the centre itself. Plantings against the rear of the low, nondescript buildings immediately to the north-west of the centre have been successful in ameliorating their immediate presence and encouraging the feel of intimacy in the courtyard.</p><p>The blue coloured concrete steps have undoubtedly become more subdued through weathering since being constructed. Chips to corners and edges have removed the blue coat and further contributed to making the geometrical elements appear tired. Similarly, the concrete has not benefited from the leachates present in the she-oaks and has become motley. Efflorescence is also noticeable in the concrete below the checker plate stainless steel edging that protects the lip of the terraces adjacent to both sides of the centre.</p><p>RWA has been accused in the past of not establishing a clear relationship between their design and site context. The Centre for Ideas courtyard does instigate a response to the unusual Minifie Nixon building that goes a long way toward displacing such a notion. There is an obvious visual relationship between the building and its purlieu. However, the geometric design does translate more successfully from plan when the polygons are realized in relief, such as the white hexagons at the entrance and the jutting blue steps. Other polygons on the courtyard\u2019s planes are more subdued and do not always articulate themselves clearly. Added to this lack of polychromatic intensity and relief, the courtyard now has a more washed-out appearance. Paradoxically, the she-oaks, which contribute to this deterioration, have made it more habitable. While the stained, butt- and branchlet-littered courtyard still reveals the robustness of RWA\u2019s design, the bold effect of the materials used in the courtyard\u2019s construction look best when shiny and new. The Centre for Ideas courtyard now sits like the building it complements: a fading gem that has lost some of its sheen.</p><h2>Design reflection</h2><blockquote><p class=\"new-body\"><span class=\"new-body-lead-in-line\">The VCA Centre for Ideas project was</span>&#160;<span class=\"new-body-lead-in-line\">an</span>&#160;important early milestone for us, in the way in which we thought about wrestling useful spaces of design interest with an often-humble external works budget.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class=\"new-body\">This project was our first real attempt at ensuring that all furniture was \u2018built in\u2019 and custom designed rather than just chosen from a factory catalogue. Similarly, with the pavement, we resisted the urge to select a product designed by someone else \u2013 the easy way. We wanted to actually design something new.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class=\"new-body\">Perhaps more importantly, this was the first time we fully explored the potential of&#160;some new details in concrete construction, which enabled us to achieve a series of complex patterns economically. The easiest was the asphalt and concrete striping, achieved with simple broom-finished concrete laid in one-metre-hit-and-miss stripes, leaving a twenty-five millimetre set-down for asphalt. This resulted in a surprisingly refined but cheap pavement, which was intended to extend a large plaza adjoining a green campus common area, but this was never realized.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class=\"new-body\">The other intricate pattern was wrought from equal and unequal, nested hexagons.&#160;It was formed very simply by placing stainless steel \u2018lost\u2019 formwork in the location of concrete shrinkage control lines. This formwork was constructed as a series of modules, then brought to line and level on site. Charcoal and white concrete was then \u2018randomly\u2019 placed within&#160;the modules to achieve a uniform terrazzo ground surface with revealed stainless joints.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class=\"new-body\">This would be the first project of many where we sought to design a ground plane of charcoal, greys and ivory, rather than seeking&#160;a pavement surface with any true colour.&#160;Colour was restricted to \u2018above ground\u2019 elements. This has proven to be a very durable principle, enabling pavements to age and show dirt with some grace, and other details to remain clean, coloured and easily able to be refurbished. The pavement acts as a \u2018black\u2019 against which even small amounts of colour show strongly.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class=\"new-body\">The scheme also reveals our interest in finding geometries of complexity rather than defaulting to the cuisenaire, grid or curvy stuff. This clearly defers to the parti pris of the building, but we believe the strategy was effective in extending exploratory ideas into the landscape.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class=\"new-body\">We are indebted to Julie Irving of the VCA for her guidance and restraint in developing this approach to the use of colour \u2013 and lack of it \u2013&#160;on this project, both as client and design critic.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class=\"new-calendar-caption\">\u2014Michael Wright,&#160;Director, Rush\\Wright associates.</p></blockquote>",

            "content": "<blockquote><p>Robert Freestone, CSIRO Publishing, paperback, 2010, 336 pages. rrp $79.95.</p></blockquote><p><em>Urban Nation</em> is Robert Freestone's latest contribution to enlarge our appreciation of Australia\u2019s urban environment. The book is admirably national in geographic scope. Temporally, it is no less ambitious, surveying projects from the beginning of European settlement until the present. Six themes structure <em>Urban Nation</em>: \u201cFounding the capital cities,\u201d \u201cPlanned rural settlement,\u201d \u201cStructuring the expansion of the metropolis,\u201d \u201cPlanned suburban communities,\u201d \u201cRenewing cities\u201d and \u201cPlanning the public realm.\u201d As these themes belie, Freestone\u2019s scrutiny is not confined to metropolises, but also includes suburban and rural hinterlands and even remote mining towns. It tracks the origins and evolution of urban landscapes through time. Laudably, attention paid to the recent past is no less comprehensive than to the distant. Freestone then distils his analysis in a preliminary list&#160;of \u201cAustralia\u2019s major sites of planning heritage\u201d as the volume\u2019s conclusion.</p><p><em>Urban Nation</em> demonstrates that Australia\u2019s cities were not planned in a vacuum and that aesthetic vision is one of many factors which have shaped them. The impact of political forces is no less potent. We might be tempted to consider this intangible dimension the result of contemporary bureaucracies; Freestone points out, however, that it has a long history. He offers Australind (1842), near Western Australia\u2019s coast, as a case in point. Its name a contraction of Australia and India, Australind was founded to breed and supply horses to the British Indian army, linking Britain\u2019s colony to its Indian possessions and effectively fuelling Empire. Visiting Australind today, one would never guess its original raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Imperialism was also a network for proliferating design ideals. As Freestone explains, Australind\u2019s parkland layout was, for instance, informed by Adelaide\u2019s now famous plan. Australia turned routinely to \u201cmother England\u201d for inspiration; Ebenezer Howard\u2019s Garden City tenets, for instance, proved one of its most portentous imports. Australia did not exclusively focus on Britain. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, the country\u2019s gaze broadened to include the United States, early importing Olmstedian and City Beautiful ideals. The American trans-Pacific flow increased during the twentieth century. New urbanism is one more recent arrival. Indeed, Andr\u00e9s Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk are now poised to realize an \u201cAusterican\u201d, to borrow Robin Boyd\u2019s term, \u201cvillage\u201d in Perth\u2019s coastal hinterland. Here, imperialism is not political, but cultural. England and America were only two of Australia\u2019s urban sources; there were others.</p><p>The formative ideals at work on Australia\u2019s urban environment have another important dimension. \u201cEarly twentieth century planning,\u201d Freestone says, \u201cwas often strongly visual as \u2018bird\u2019s-eye\u2019 schemes were used to convey an holistic sense of civic design.\u201d \u201cThe art\u201d was lost, he continues, \u201cas planning entered its scientific and bureaucratic phases (starting in the 1920s).\u201d In the 1980s, I personally experienced repercussions of the loss. Setting out an assignment in a landscape architecture history class, I required students to trace and redraw their accompanying illustrations from books, believing they would learn more from graphic analyses than from photocopying images. Afterwards, two students approached me in tears. \u201cWe\u2019re in urban planning and we aren\u2019t taught how to draw!\u201d</p><p>Planning\u2019s art later returned, this time beneath a new \u201curban design\u201d banner. Freestone identified the 1990s as its Australian \u201crenaissance.\u201d Urban terrain has always been professionally contested. Some now see urban design as a new discipline, filling the void created by planning\u2019s departure. This splintering is history repeating itself. America\u2019s first \u201ccity planning\u201d (Harvard, 1909) and \u201ccivic art\u201d (University of Illinois, 1912) courses were offered, tellingly, as landscape architecture specializations. Although planning later became independent, landscape architecture never abandoned urban design.</p><p>After reading <em>Urban Nation</em>, I was left with a lingering query, one suggested by the book\u2019s subtitle. What was professional planning\u2019s distinct contribution to \u201cAustralia\u2019s planning heritage\u201d? Admittedly, this was not necessarily a question Freestone set out to answer. Nonetheless, for me, issues of professional authorship, if not identity, percolate throughout the book. Freestone grapples with these issues, if only implicitly, in his introduction. \u201cArchitecture, landscape architecture, construction and engineering,\u201d he notes, \u201chave begun to systematically document and assess past contributions to the urban built environment.\u201d Planning, by contrast, \u201chas been relatively silent.\u201d Presumably, Freestone sees <em>Urban Nation</em> as raising urban planning\u2019s voice, even if only as a secondary concern. Having implied that planning is distinct from its allied professions, he next devotes a section to \u201cunderstanding and defining planning.\u201d This discussion, for me, illuminated \u201cunderstanding\u201d planning activities more than it did \u201cdefining\u201d the profession. My confusion perhaps underscores Freestone\u2019s observation that \u201cthe core meaning and mission of planning remains a topic of debate.\u201d</p><p><em>Urban Nation</em> considers hundreds of plans. Many of these, along with the ideals which informed them, were the products of architects and landscape architects (authors are consistently identified by name, but not always by profession). Indeed, this attribute makes the book no less a contribution to those professions\u2019 literature than to planning history. Nonetheless, if one filtered Freestone\u2019s examples through an authorship sieve, then one wonders how many would be found to be the products of urban planners versus architects or landscape architects (et al)? One might also then be able to discern the ebb and flow of the various professions\u2019 contributions through time. Considering planning\u2019s eventual abandonment of \u201cphysical\u201d design, for instance, might one anticipate its contributions to be latent?</p><p>Freestone\u2019s canvass of more than two centuries of Australian urban output is a feat nothing short of magisterial in itself. Ultimately, <em>Urban Nation</em> is a monumental step toward rectifying, in Freestone\u2019s words, the \u201cskew towards architecture\u201d within \u201cformal recognition of Australia\u2019s built heritage.\u201d</p>",

In his book, The Life and Death of the Australian Backyard, Hall looks deeply into the changing landscape of suburban Australia and the causes and effects of such change. \u201cThe yard symbolizes a standard of domestic comfort to which the majority of Australians have traditionally aspired,\u201d Hall says. However, since the 1990s, in what was a dramatic and sudden change, new housing developments increasingly reduced the size of their backyards. This is nowhere more evident than in the aerial photography used in the book. In one aerial shot of the suburb of Boondall in north Brisbane, the left side of the photo shows older residential areas with significant tree cover, while the right portion of the photo shows newer housing where roofs dominate the land area.&#160;Hall investigates a range of possibilities as to the reason behind these changes, including housing design, longer working hours and even a declining interest in gardening, and draws solutions as to how developers can return to traditional Australian values under urban consolidation.</p>",

Author and architect Richard Aitken takes us on a delightful expedition of what he confesses is his personal selection of key moments and stylistic movements in Australian gardens. The book\u2019s beautiful presentation of text and images \u2013 from paintings, prints, plans and photographs \u2013 expertly depicts four centuries of gardening history. From seventeenth-century imaginings, to the Australian bush landscape and modern city settings, each place and time is beautifully reviewed by Aitken and supported by evocative images, many unearthed by Aitken himself in his tireless research for this book. The book is almost encyclopaedic in its content and at the same time shows a deep and personal respect for this timeless pursuit. With this book, Aitken wished to open a conversation that results in understanding and appreciation for both exceptional and representative examples of Australian gardens, and there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s done just that.</p>",

Firstly it is of great importance to develop novel forms of design thinking that contribute to both disciplinary knowledge and sustainability in order to ease the tension between the two and pacify scepticism. The second statement Mostafavi makes concerns scale and finding alternative design approaches that manage large scale. With that, Mostafavi proclaims that the book\u2019s aim is to provide a framework that presents \u201cnothing short of a new ethics and aesthetics of the urban.\u201d Whether the book achieves this hyperbolic goal is up for discussion.</p>",

As part of a four-day site exploration of the Western District, the book\u2019s participants look at the Indigenous and European history of the area, the topography and its artistic past. The book then moves into essays and deconstructions by cultural historians, design theorists, a geologist and an anthropologist, each imparting a new facet to this place. A photographic chapter of 117 homesteads of the nineteenth-century Western District provides yet another narrative to the region with its architectural history.

Quite simply, their presentation in vivid 3D is a technical achievement of awe-inspiring brilliance, which in time may become the norm for articulating complex architectural propositions.</p><p>There are so many standout exhibitions at this year\u2019s biennale that it is a challenge to fashion a \u201cmust see\u201d shortlist. The Belgian Pavilion, though, is a definite. Gallery-like in its sensibility, its hangings of fabric and flooring remnants create metaphoric paintings that summon memories of architectural spaces in which people once met. The Canadian Pavilion\u2019s \u201chylozoic ground\u201d is another. An ethereal architectural installation, it immerses you in a computer-controlled forest of constantly reacting and interacting fern-like forms. I was also intrigued, engaged and hugely impressed by the decidedly urbane Dutch Pavilion, which at first glance appeared bereft of content save for a ceiling of orthogonal blue \u201cclouds\u201d and two staircases. Climb those stairs, however, and you greet at eye level a model city \u2013 empty apart from buildings. It is a metaphor for humankind\u2019s propensity to concrete over anything, anywhere, for short-term gain.</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to mention the Commissioner\u2019s Cocktail Party sponsored by Austral Bricks. Held in the sculpture courtyard of Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, which houses the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, this gathering of Australian architects and international colleagues was addressed by Janet Holmes \u00e0 Court; the Australian Ambassador to Italy, Mr David Ritchie AO; and the Director of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Mr Philip Rylands. The message was clear: the exhibition does Australia proud and acknowledges the contribution of Australian architects to the international sustainability discussion. The welcome to the Peggy Guggenheim Museum from Philip Rylands was very warm, and the ambassador stated that he was captivated by the impact and the technical brilliance.</p><p>As we face the future with all its challenges and complexities, it is heartening to be reminded in Venice that the solutions to a better and more sustainable future are being interrogated. Through the discourse at the biennale we are able to bring the issues and challenges of a sustainable future to a wider audience. In this context, the theme, People Meet in Architecture, makes perfect sense.</p><p>The twelfth Architecture Biennale runs until 21 November. If you can, please go and experience its rich and enriching mix of thinking and camaraderie.</p><p>Karl Fender,&#160;National President, Australian Institute of Architects</p>",

            "content": "<p>It is awards season again and, as usual, the presentation of the Australian Institute of Architects national architecture awards forms the core of the November issue of <em>Architecture Australia</em>. The premiated work is outstanding and points to the strength of Australia\u2019s architectural culture. Readers who perused the outcomes of the state awards, published in the July issue of the magazine, will have already realized just how fierce the competition was \u2013 to be considered for the nationals is a significant achievement.</p><p>But, what purpose awards? Of course winning an award makes individual architects (and clients) very happy and, beyond personal gratification, awards can play an important role in the marketing of architectural practices. Award programs, like publishing, are also an important vehicle for drawing projects to the attention of the broader architectural community, making them available for the communal, consensual process that leads to the formation of architectural canons (as formulated by Juan Pablo Bonta). As I wrote way back in November 2003, now that the jury has drawn our attention to these projects it is up to the architectural community as a whole to decide, together and over time, which works will go on to form an indelible part of the country\u2019s collective architectural consciousness.</p><p>But awards programs also have a role beyond promotion and the construction of the canon. This year our two \u201cCritics Respond\u201d pieces provide very different responses to the awards, arrived at through very different interpretative frames. Yet both expect the program to do more than simply record where things are at at the upper end of the profession. Philip Goldswain and Melinda Payne approach the awards in terms of what we might learn about architecture\u2019s potential contribution to culture and society. They look for projects that \u201cadvance an understanding of the architect as an agent for positive social, environmental and cultural change\u201d. Eli Giannini\u2019s statistical analysis of the state and national award outcomes leads to an impassioned plea for the program to engage with the depth and diversity of Australian architectural culture.</p><p>The diversity of practices included was one of the strengths of Now + When, the Australian contribution to this year\u2019s Venice Architectural Biennale. Many of the practices represented are well known within Australia, but there is also a decent spread of younger, smaller or simply lesser-known contributors. With the Institute tending to select proposals that feature groups of contributors, it will be important to continue to pursue diversity in these exhibitions, lest the same architects represent Australia again and again.</p><p>Of course diversity is also a big issue for <em>Architecture Australia</em>. Like awards and international exhibitions, the standard for projects reviewed in the magazine is extremely high, and our leaning toward projects with a public component can unintentionally exclude younger or smaller practices. Yet we are very aware that there are many more meaningful projects and practices out there than feature regularly in the public culture of architecture. With this in mind, we are exploring ways to include a wider range of contributors within the pages of the magazine. The mapping exercises we conducted in the last issue, while extremely resource-intensive, offers one strategy, and we will pursue and develop others over the coming issues.</p><p>Look out for our requests for information \u2013 on twitter, email alerts and so on \u2013 as we explore things to map. We are beginning with work funded through the stimulus package, as outlined in the box to the right.&#160;</p><p><em>Justine Clark, editor</em> Architecture Australia.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Annabelle Pegrum discusses the role of competitions in procuring design, with the recent University of Canberra campus competition as a case study.</strong></p><p>Wherever you are in Canberra, whenever you look up, you are connected to the landscape and the great panorama of the city. It is part of the brilliance of the place that \u2013 in nearly a century of development, through successive political regimes and planning themes and dreams \u2013 this powerful idea of the landscape city remains robust and always evident.</p><p>The gentle rolling hills that embrace and frame, the great expanse of sky, the ever-present sense of the bush beyond and the gardens within \u2013 it was a design competition that delivered this Canberra. It was a design competition that introduced Australia, and arguably the world, to the extraordinary Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin. You have to marvel at the courage or sheer hubris of those politicians who in 1912 put the city of their imagination to the test of the design talent of the world. Whatever the flaws of the process, they got this right. The winning Griffin design for Canberra is that one big idea that makes you believe in the possibilities of greatness and makes all other entries appear somewhat clumsy.</p><blockquote><p><em>I remain a believer in design competitions. I have seen first-hand the extent to which they elicit quality discourse and inquiry, encourage and discover new talent, target and inspire the best in experienced designers and unearth remarkable solutions to complex challenges.</em></p></blockquote><p>Canberra remains a testament to the value of design competitions, open or invited, national or international. The Australian War Memorial, the National Carillon, the National Gallery, the High Court, the National Museum, the Portrait Gallery, Commonwealth Place, Reconciliation Place, the memorials on Anzac Parade, the National Arboretum (a wonder in the making) and of course Parliament House. Each is the product of a competition, all are memorable and most have been recognized with awards.</p><p>In 2001, as part of the centenary initiatives, the National Capital Authority, of which I was then chief executive, made a commitment to creating \u201copportunities for Australians to lead\u201d by affirming competitions as central to its procurement of design. I remain a believer in design competitions. I have seen first-hand the extent to which they elicit quality discourse and inquiry, encourage and discover new talent, target and inspire the best in experienced designers and unearth remarkable solutions to complex challenges.</p><p>There are of course some key ingredients to the success of competitions. The Australian Institute of Architects and the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects have gone to some lengths to articulate these in guidelines for their conduct; any decent competition should have their endorsement. However, three things are, I think, critical. Firstly, the design can only be as good as the brief. Thoughtful reflection and inquiry are fundamental, and in my experience the brief is best when it is a simple statement about the \u201cintent\u201d and \u201ccreative idea\u201d rather than a litany of space schedules and feasibility studies. The search for the one really good design needs to be as exploratory as is possible.</p><p>A second essential ingredient is the nature of the jury. Design professionals expect and generally welcome critique. Awards are about celebration and peer review. Opinion is encouraged and debate central to engagement. All of this means that in a competition, scrutiny of the jury for its composition, intellectual capital and collective experience may be enough to limit or expand the field of entries.</p><p>Finally, in an ideal world the winning designer should be commissioned and the work built. In \u201cdesign ideas\u201d competitions it is not always possible to commit to engagement but it is important to be up-front about the potential for a commission. At first the relationship between client and designer can be one of awkward overtures before the relationship is founded, especially in a blind competition where the winner may be unknown to the client or inexperienced in project delivery. Regardless, both parties must persevere with good will so that the design can be realized with integrity. No doubt procurement through competition can be fraught \u2013 witness the struggle of J\u00f8rn Utzon and his masterful Opera House or for that matter of the Griffins in the \u201cexecution\u201d of their design. Despite these classic examples of bureaucratic failures in delivery, and without beating a drum, the built works remain outstanding.</p><p>In the contemporary context, Australian university campuses have emerged as great platforms for innovative urban design and architecture. Universities are underpinned by philosophical premise, have captured populations and today reach out to the wider community. Many are sited on vast tracts of land or are fortuitously in the heart of buzzing urban areas. The experience and \u201clook and feel\u201d of the campuses are fundamental to their success as educational institutions of choice. The benchmark set by Leon van Schaik at RMIT deserves mention. He is to be congratulated for commissioning design that presents the university as a hothouse for exploratory architecture. Not surprisingly, many universities have embraced design competitions as <br />part of their rejuvenation and development tool kit.</p><p>Back in the national capital, the University of Canberra is in a swirl of growth and renewal. Much more than a coming of age, the place has a sense of energy in which all things are possible. Under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor Stephen Parker, academic programs, profiles and research have been strengthened, student numbers have increased dramatically, new ties with other tiers of education are being forged, the larger region embraced \u2013 and the campus environment recognized as vital to the future. Last year a campus masterplan was endorsed and the position of University Architect established.</p><p>The UC campus is an intriguing place. The more time you spend there, the more you appreciate the original 1968 Hassell McConnell design. Within the 118 hectares of largely open space, the substantial concourse enclosed by formal modernist buildings remains the heartland for students and staff. It is the front and backyard of the campus, successfully mixing public and private space. Part of the city aesthetic, the campus is indivisible from the wider landscape. The distant hills provide a rare borrowed landscape and kangaroo herds still emerge from the wooded areas.</p><p>Yet, like so many other universities, the campus environment must shift to accommodate changing aspirations and needs. Outside of the core, the usual devil business of access and car parks and growth needs structure and attention. The concourse and the landscape require definition to secure the natural attributes, imbue a distinctive character and accommodate expansion, all of which calls for an intelligent and imaginative response. As part of that response, the university embarked on an ambitious campus design ideas competition. Thirty-five entries were received from all over Australia from architects, landscape architects, professionals and students. As anticipated, the results demonstrated the remarkable diversity and ingenuity of designers, with solutions that stretched the potential of the design brief.</p><p>The competition was unusual, evolving as a series of \u201cdesign modules\u201d. Competitors were required to enter a mandatory module for the central concourse and then had the discretion to submit for all or none of six other modules. These included a landscape character plan; selecting sites for key future buildings such as a chancellery, library and great hall; and ideas for the university green. The primary objectives were to create a striking and stimulating heartland and to establish a strong physical identity and presence for the campus proper. A separate statement of design intent was drafted for each module \u2013 some more successful than others in eliciting innovative responses.</p><p>The jury included architects, landscape architects, graphic designers and those with experience in the environment, culture and the arts. A panel of design students judged the entries independently, with their selection counting as one vote. At the end of an invigorating two days of discussion, the jury awarded prizes to two entrants, each winning two modules, and also gave three supplementary prizes.</p><p>MORQ won the modules for the Concourse and the Siting of Key Buildings. Their concourse design is a highly sophisticated and integrated set of spatial proposals, presenting a strong and elegant vision that is unique to the place and respects the existing built fabric. It creates places of different character within a unified construct and cleverly interlocks with the city grid and the wider campus.</p><p>Mark Tyrrell and Sharon Wright won the modules for the Landscape Character Plan and the University Green. Their landscape plan is a powerful and poetic proposal that defines the campus from within and without, drawing with a genuine certainty upon the Canberra bush setting and regional landscape.</p><p>The winning entries are from teams of emerging designers \u2013 visionary ideas that deserve to be developed further. As the jury noted, although conceived separately, the designs subtly complement each other and could work well together. To that end the university has commissioned the teams for a week-long collaborative workshop to develop their proposals.</p><p>Competitions have earned a valued place in the procurement of innovative design. Sometimes controversial, nevertheless they remain a worthy source of creativity and talent in the pursuit of excellence in architecture and design.</p><p><strong>Annabelle Pegrum is a Professorial Fellow of the University of Canberra and the University Architect.</strong></p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>In their new book, Leon van Schaik and Geoffrey London explore the ways governments, universities, institutions and communities can procure intelligent architecture. Here the authors outline their findings.</strong></p><p>When he read the final draft of our recent book, <em>Procuring&#160;Innovative Architecture</em>, Steve Ashton of Ashton Raggatt McDougall commented that it read like a crusade. We looked at each other and said, \u201cWell, yes! It is a crusade!\u201d</p><p>The book is one outcome of research initiated by Geoffrey London when he took on the role of Government Architect in Western Australia in 2004 and approached Leon van Schaik to discover what could be learned from the architectural procurement processes he had developed at RMIT, which had resulted in a number of innovative, peer-awarded buildings. Together we embarked on an ARC Linkage Grant, which enabled us to research what clients with the ambition to procure innovative architecture were doing in various parts&#160;of the world, looking at government bodies (London) and at other institutions and private clients (van Schaik). In this, we were able to reflect on our own experiences with procurement in the university and government sectors in relation to a wide range of international models and examples.</p><p>The processes developed at RMIT have given that university an international reputation for procuring innovative architecture and building the local architectural culture while doing so. Award-winning buildings include Edmond and Corrigan\u2019s Building 8, ARM\u2019s Storey Hall (acknowledged by Charles Jencks as the first built use of fractals), Allan Powell\u2019s Building 94, Wood / Marsh\u2019s Building 220, John Wardle\u2019s Print Technology Building, and Wardle and DesignInc\u2019s Life Sciences Building. There were also some notable near misses (Lyons\u2019 Swanston A\u2019Beckett Sports complex, Durbach Block\u2019s student housing and Kerstin Thompson\u2019s Long Life Loose Fit flatted factories). Soon to be completed are Sean Godsell\u2019s Design Research Hub (2011) <br />and Lyons\u2019 Swanston A\u2019Beckett Academic Building (2013). The work of Peter Elliott Architecture + Urban Design upgrades much of the existing fabric and knits the whole together with inspired urban design. In the book, we complement an explication of RMIT\u2019s processes and projects with a discussion of the Kumamoto Artpolis \u2013 the result of an exemplary commissioning process. As with RMIT, many architects now very well known received their first institutional commissions through this enlightened, local architecture culture-building program. These include Tadao Ando, Toyo Ito, Kazuyo Sejima and Itsuko Hasegawa. By contrast, highly politicized commissioning processes in Malaysia have led to architects on the political outer (like Architron Design Consultants) developing independent \u201cpost-holing\u201d strategies to bring their innovation to the notice of clients. While Singapore, after decades of being determinedly \u201cinternational\u201d in its commissioning practices, has set out to become a \u201cdesign city\u201d, using many of the methods pioneered at RMIT and at Kumamoto (thanks to the research of Richard Hassell of WOHA).</p><p>Our European exemplars began with Barcelona, which brings in-depth work on understanding the city and working with local communities to the fore. (This became the inspiration for Beth George\u2019s research into deep urban knowledge in the context of Perth. Recorded in chapter five of the book, this work suggests that in Perth, as in Barcelona, a deep understanding could open up new opportunities for innovative commissioning). We also looked at the very deliberate construction of a local culture of architecture in Ticino \u2013 acknowledging that this was enabled by the research of Aldo Rossi \u2013 and examined the extraordinary architectural culture of Belgium. Here, more than most places, Judith Blau\u2019s observation about the disappearing middle in practices is true. With twice as many architects per head of population as the Netherlands, this is an unusually thin environment for small practices, but they triumph over this adversity again and again. The dilemmas of the Graz School are also pertinent \u2013 a break-through-or-bust approach resulted in a vivid flowering, but has ended with most of the recent important commissions going to outsiders, something that happened in Barcelona too. The case of Slovenia is startlingly different, with a very deliberate construction of a local culture of architectural excellence through an architectural cooperative that was formed in the transition from communist rule. Funded as a cultural body not an industry body, it was required to incorporate from the outset a gallery for exhibiting the works of its members. In the book, these examples are matched with reflections on the achievements of two stellar commissioners of architecture in London: Fred Manson (Southwark) and Roland Paoletti (Jubilee Line). Manson describes how, when&#160;he began his work at Southwark, about 90 percent of the people living there wanted to move away. Ten years later when he finished, about 80 percent would not consider living anywhere else.</p><blockquote><p><em>At the end of the research we realized that, although we had set out to identify good processes, we were everywhere describing the energy and vision of individuals who believe in the power of architecture to improve our lives.</em></p></blockquote><p>Unusual commissioning in the United States was also investigated. Columbus, Indiana, has benefited from generations of belief in the improving effects of good architecture, commencing perhaps with Robert Owen\u2019s attempt to establish a model town in New Harmony nearby. This city of 60,000 people boasts thirty-six works of architecture classified as national monuments. These include such seminal works as Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates\u2019 Fire Station No. 4, works by most of the East Coast luminaries and also a strand of the local Midwest architecture including wonderful churches by both Saarinens and by Harry Weese. We also looked at the determined reconstruction of the Los Angeles civic spine as promoted by constellations of concerned citizens, and the radical green revamping of the port. The determined promotion of local architectural culture by Richard Koshalek \u2013 both through early commissions for Frank Gehry and more recently through commissions for young architects at Pasadena\u2019s Art Center College of Design, South Campus \u2013 was also examined, as was the unexpected revolt against this program. Perhaps the most extraordinary transformation of a university campus in the United States is that initiated at the University of Cincinnati by incoming dean Jay Chatterjee, president Joseph Steger and CFO Dale McGirr. Here, buildings by Eisenman, Gehry, Moore Ruble Yudell, Gwathmey, Thom Mayne and Tschumi are yoked together through the integrative work of landscape architect Hargreaves (the same urban design planning role that Peter Elliott has played at RMIT). In contrast, the wealthiest Ivy League universities have pursued a \u201ctrophy\u201d architecture approach.</p><p>Returning to Australia, we reflected on the work of the inaugural five-year period of the Office of the Government Architect in Western Australia and outlined the research underpinning the approach adopted by London and his team. The key features of this approach were:</p><blockquote><p>\u2022 criterion-based selection of architects on major government projects</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2022 design review processes for government-funded or&#160;supported projects, both existing and new</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2022 design workshops for government-held sites</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2022 an emphasis on life-time costing</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2022 competitions for innovative housing models</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2022 systems for encouraging participation in government projects by new and emerging practices. This included panels of emerging architects and an award for the work of emerging architects</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2022 processes for promoting the conscious development of a Western Australian discourse in architecture and its procurement</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u2022 drafting of an architecture (and landscape architecture) policy for government</p></blockquote><p>The outcomes of this approach were scrutinized by review panels convened in London and in Perth. Those in London included some of the luminaries in commissioning there, members of CABE (a source of inspiration) and Professor Kate Heron, whose work on the Arts Council England was a valuable sounding board. This section of the research considers the views of small to medium practices (Iredale Pedersen Hook, CODA Studio, Gresley Abas), as well as those of larger firms (Cox Howlett &amp; Bailey Woodland and Hassell), developer Adrian Fini of Mirvac and senior bureaucrats working in the planning realm.</p><p>The results of the program pursued in Western Australia include a number of projects now coming to completion: the State Theatre Centre by Kerry Hill Architects; the Albany Entertainment Centre by Cox Howlett &amp; Bailey Woodland; Perth Arena by ARM, Cameron Chisholm &amp; Nicol and RTKL; Leighton mixed-use development with projects by Kerry Hill Architects, Space Agency and Mirvac Design; Brookfield Multiplex with Cox Howlett &amp; Bailey Woodland and Multiplex with Alex Popov; Fiona Stanley Hospital by Hassell with Silver Thomas Hanley and Hames Sharley; the Affordable Sustainable Housing initiative and others.</p><p>Bringing this wide range of strategies, approaches, contexts and reflections together has been highly productive. However, at the end of the research we realized that, although we had set out to identify good processes, we were everywhere describing the energy and vision of individuals who believe in the power of architecture to improve our lives. In Belgium, the initiator of a program that commissioned work from emerging architects reflected ruefully that the program was not going so well under his successor. Perhaps as Joyce Appleby argues in The Relentless Revolution: a History of Capitalism, \u201cSelf-assertive individuals did the innovating \u2026 and they bungled as often as they hit the mark \u2026 There is no way to compel innovation.\u201d</p><p><strong><em>Leon van Schaik AO</em> is Innovation Professor of Architecture at RMIT University. <em>Geoffrey London</em> is Professor of Architecture at the University of Western Australia and Victorian State Government Architect.</strong></p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A recent invited competition by the Victorian state government saw four practices deliver intelligent schemes for bicycle storage at railway stations. Review by Peter Johns.</strong></p><p>After seventy years at the periphery, bicycles are making&#160;a comeback. Governments are now identifying them as low-hanging fruit in efforts to cut emissions. The shift has been recent \u2013 it was only two years ago that the Victorian state government proposed banning bicycles from rush-hour trains, saying they were getting in the way. An unexpected backlash from cyclists derailed the ban and, to placate pedal-powered voters, the state government announced that $1 million worth of bike cages would be installed at twenty train stations. The first Bicycle Victoria Parkiteer was in place later that year, and they are now located at more than forty stations around the city.</p><p>Parkiteers are utilitarian boxes, painted blue, and they do the job originally required of them \u2013 parking bikes. Many modifications have been made to the design over the forty-odd installations, so its basic functionality is improving. But while the locks and racks are working well, surveys have revealed that the public finds the cages less than inviting and, in some cases, people don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re for public use.</p><p>The Department of Transport (DoT) with the Office of the Victorian Government Architect (OVGA) recently sought out an architect to rethink the Parkiteer so that it might encourage more riders to participate. The brief called for a new design, \u201ccelebrating and inspiring\u201d cycling as a viable mode of transport. It would have an elevated status in the urban realm, comparable to railway stations and freeways.</p><p>Time constraints prevented an expression-of-interest process. Instead, the brief was sent to four emerging practices who had worked with government before and who could start immediately. They were each paid to deliver a concept design, with the winner then going on to a fixed-fee contract.</p><p>The four participating practices were BKK, Terroir, Six Degrees and Phooey. Rather than a rethink from the ground up, most practices opted to retain the three-car-park module of the existing Parkiteer. Most seemed keen for the new cages to be a subtle evolution rather than a revolution in bike parking.</p><p>BKK made some minor alterations to the perimeter cage and topped the structure with a shimmering golden crown, an over-the-top civic gesture paying its respects to Marcus Barlow\u2019s Manchester Unity building and Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin\u2019s Newman College. This was seen as a fitting response to the grimy interchanges the cages would often find themselves in, while the perched crown would also improve wayfinding around visually cluttered station precincts. The design embeds a digital display of the shelter\u2019s carbon-reduction scores into golden shards, wearing the shelter\u2019s sustainability raison d\u2019\u00eatre on its sleeve.</p><p>Terroir accepted the constraints of the low budget and exchanged the standard mesh for randomly arranged tiled sheets of expanded metal. This would make for something simple, recognizable and robust, and quite mute. They wanted to avoid fussiness and heroics and have adopted a contextual palette which picks up on the bi-directional patterns on bicycle reflectors. Placing the emphasis on the materiality of the skin allows existing Parkiteers to be retrofitted easily and makes the cage easily extendable. It is a jewellery box formed from industrial materials, its presence signalled by bouncing spangled reflections.</p><p>Six Degrees was the only practice to depart completely from the three-car-park Parkiteer format. The team\u2019s \u201cbike hub\u201d resembles a Mobil station lily pad and functions rather like one too, acting as a bicycle bowser with an air pump and water. Six Degrees found that a circular plan, based on the bike wheel, was the most efficient way to store the required twenty-six bicycles, and were keen to note that this circular arrangement would allow for a one-way circulation loop, very handy at rush hour. It\u2019s nicely finished off with an airport airside aesthetic and recycled-car-tyre flooring.</p><blockquote><p><em>This competition is a bit of a milestone ...&#160;The architects were contracted fairly, they received peer review, and the competitiveness between the practices was good-spirited as&#160;it wasn\u2019t all about fee bids.</em></p></blockquote><p>Six Degrees (an all-cycling office) considered the rider\u2019s experience by improving circulation and providing seats where you could pause to take off your ankle straps. These thoughtful little details help convey to cyclists that they are now valued. It was one simple cyclist-friendly feature like this that may have clinched it for winner PHOOEY Architects \u2013 a covered entry so you needn\u2019t get drenched while fumbling for your swipe card.</p><p>PHOOEY\u2019s sawtooth roof and plate-steel palette is meant to echo the industrial shed, and \u201cshed\u201d is a word that Peter Ho uses deliberately instead of \u201ccage\u201d. Cages protect people from hungry animals inside, but bikes aren\u2019t tigers. Sheds protect the goods inside from the people and weather outside. As the goods are bicycles, the wall fins can be well spaced. PHOOEY\u2019s shed, now documented, comes in prefabricated chunks and uses off-the-shelf parts wherever it can. The shed can be put up in a day once the slab is dry. All offcuts from the six-metre vertical bars are inserted back into the building as cross-bracing that doubles as decoration. At one end of the shed is a laser-cut steel panel that might display cycling maps of the area.</p><p>All the designs adopted the Parkiteer\u2019s hanging bicycles arrangement. Odd, as this is not an easy way to store a commuter bike, and would hardly encourage more people onto bikes. In design development, PHOOEY dispensed with hanging bikes and only had to add 100 mm to the width.</p><p>It\u2019s surprising that three of the firms submitted plans very similar to the current three-car-park Parkiteer. Rectangles were not prescribed in the brief, and the current cages are hardly ever put within the car park. Other shapes might have suited the nature of the task as well if not better. But given cost considerations along with hunches about what the engineers at the DoT might prefer, this could be understandable.</p><p>This competition is a bit of a milestone. Scott Balmforth of Terroir calls the competition\u2019s process \u201cbrilliant and valuable\u201d. The OVGA has proven itself useful as a bridge between practice and government, looking out for both sides. The architects were contracted fairly, they received peer review, and the competitiveness between the practices was good-spirited as it wasn\u2019t all about fee bids. They even got together at the end to see one another\u2019s entries and share a slab.</p><p><strong>Peter Johns is an architect, web designer and editor of Butterpaper.</strong></p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Practices, processes and politics of Indigenous place-making \u2013 Paul Walker reports on the recent symposium.</strong></p><p>Melbourne likes to tout its multicultural credentials, the Greek precincts of Lonsdale Street or Oakleigh, Vietnamese Victoria Street and Springvale, the Italian heritage of Carlton; the waxing or waning diversity of Dandenong, Brunswick and Footscray. The pride in this mix \u2013 manifest in street festivals, food tourism, Lygon Street\u2019s Piazza Italia, municipal urban decor in Footscray and Chinatown, and in <em>The Travellers</em>, the vast kinetic sculpture by Nadim Karam installed on the Sandridge Bridge to celebrate the city\u2019s migrant communities \u2013 barely registers any active Indigenous presence in Australia\u2019s second largest city. The traces of Indigenous Melbourne are there, but they are scattered and aestheticized, museumized or overtly presented as heritage.</p><p>Practices, Processes and Politics of Indigenous Place-making was organized to address this gap. The symposium was hosted by Janet McGaw and Anoma Pieris of the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning at the University of Melbourne as part of an Australian Research Council Linkage research project focused on the prospect of an Indigenous cultural centre for Melbourne. It was preceded the previous evening by a well-attended Melbourne Conversation at BMW Edge where some of the symposium\u2019s speakers presented to a public audience. Pieris and McGaw\u2019s partners in the research are the Melbourne City Council, Reconciliation Victoria, and the Victorian Traditional Owners Land Justice Group. Officials from the city who attended did little more than listen. Rather, the key interaction both at the symposium and the \u201cconversation\u201d was between representatives of the Indigenous community looking for ways to initiate a cultural centre in the city and those advocating that architecture should play a significant role in this.</p><p>Greg Burgess spoke at both events about his experiences in working with traditional owners in Victoria and elsewhere in Australia, most notably on the Brambuk Aboriginal Cultural Centre in the Grampians. Brambuk and his design for the Uluru\u2013Kata Tjuta centre hung in the air, so to speak, throughout the symposium, tacitly the exemplars of an architecture that transcends the \u201cbuilding with boomerangs on the wall\u201d that traditional owner representative Gary Murray wants a new cultural centre in Melbourne to avoid. Burgess\u2019s discussion of Brambuk focused on the emergence of its design as a collaborative process, and one that was transformative for him as a designer. But despite the well-deserved regard that Burgess clearly enjoys among&#160;many in the Indigenous community, Brambuk is problematic for some. Murray, a member of various agencies and boards active in promoting the rights of traditional owners in Victoria and acknowledged at the symposium to have initiated the current moves for an Indigenous cultural centre for Melbourne, noted that Brambuk\u2019s location on crown land meant that it was not owned by the community whose culture it is meant to sustain. In a presentation pointedly called \u201cWe Don\u2019t Dream\u201d Carroll Go-Sam, an architect and researcher at the Aboriginal Environments Research Centre at the University of Queensland, offered as a counter example to the overt zoomorphism of the Burgess buildings a recent design for an Indigenous centre at Musgrave Park in Brisbane by architect Richard Kirk \u2013 rather than prioritizing the representation in built form of the cultures it is intended to accommodate, its aesthetic austerity came from their other, more straightforward community needs.</p><p>Like Burgess and Go-Sam, many other speakers in the symposium reflected on the process of negotiation in the course of successfully developing a design and delivering a building that works for its community. Emmanuel Kasarherou, director of the Tjibaou Cultural Centre in Noumea, was explicit about the value of ongoing collaboration between architects and the communities which such a centre is intended to serve. He set out the complex story of cultural politics in New Caledonia in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating in the assassination of Kanak leader Jean-Marie Tjibaou in 1989. The centre that was subsequently initiated under his name has taken as a principal institutional ethos Tjibaou\u2019s own belief that Kanak identity was not to be found in the past but rather to be established by engaging with the present and the future. Aligned with this, Kasarherou believes that the success of the Tjibaou Centre was achieved through working with the best available professional skills, both to hone the mission of the centre and to develop its design; the significant resources made available to realize the project meant that these skills could be drawn from anywhere in the world. What Renzo Piano Building Workshop brought to the project after winning the international design competition for the Tjibaou in 1991 was not only its considerable technical and aesthetic inventiveness but also an ability to collaborate with and learn from representatives of Kanak communities. This led, for example, to the decision to change the entry to the centre so that it would be off-axis, a more culturally appropriate approach.</p><p>Kasarherou\u2019s testimonial to the value of Piano\u2019s input in shaping Tjibaou\u2019s success no doubt pleased the architects in the symposium audience. Lisa Findley, another of the international keynotes at the event, underwrote Kasarherou\u2019s point with her presentation of several other recent \u201ccultural centres\u201d whose construction coincided with moments of political change and empowerment. But despite her judicious words about consultation and participation, Findley\u2019s slides of, for example, the Norwegian Sami Parliament building designed by Stein Halvorsen and Christian Sundby, kept their focus on architecture in a conventional, highly aestheticized manner.</p><p>Two presentations by architects closely identified with their own Indigenous communities pointed to the complexity and possible opportunities in being both indigene and architect. Dillon Kombumerri of Merrima showed several of that group\u2019s accomplished designs, but framed his polished presentation in terms that emphasized the absolute priority for Indigenous designers of their country and the needs and wishes of their community over the individual\u2019s own authorial position as designer. Rewi Thompson prefaced his lively survey of his own career by explaining the ubiquity of \u201cindigenous place-making\u201d in contemporary Aotearoa/New Zealand: rather than being confined to the \u201ccultural centre\u201d, the <em>marae</em> \u2013 the key collective space for Maori \u2013 is found everywhere now from schools, to prisons and government offices. And as demonstrated in Thompson\u2019s own design from his student days for a marae for Ngati Poneke in Wellington, the forms of marae need not be prescriptively related to tradition. While Thompson\u2019s presentation of his work certainly demonstrated that he had carved out a role as a distinguished designer in his own right, the framework of obligation under which he sometimes finds himself working is akin to that delineated by Kombumerri. Thompson explained the rebuilding of the Rangiatea church in Otaki in these terms: the historic building attacked by arson in 1995 has been rebuilt as an exact replica with Thompson\u2019s participation because this is what the local Maori community determined should occur.</p><p>Perhaps amplifying these points from Thompson\u2019s and Kombumerri\u2019s presentations, one view that gained support from some symposium attendees was that the planning and making of an Indigenous cultural centre in Melbourne should be used as an opportunity to further develop the creative and professional capacities already established or nascent in Victoria\u2019s Indigenous communities \u2013 or, for that matter, among traditional owners living in Melbourne but from other parts of Australia. In Murray\u2019s opening remarks to the symposium, he asked the question \u201cWhere is the space of traditional owners in this state and in the city of Melbourne?\u201d Making a lively and compelling physical space must also open up spaces of opportunity in the city\u2019s professional, intellectual and commercial worlds. Practices, processes and politics of Indigenous place-making, then, will involve thinking inventively not only about design in such place-making, but also about the relationship between designers and the communities for whom they work.</p><p><strong>Paul Walker is associate professor and deputy dean of the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning at the University of Melbourne.</strong></p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>\u201cAre we there yet?\u201d Liam Young reviews a recent exhibition at the London Festival of Architecture that speculates on Australian architecture through the idea of the road trip.</strong></p><p>I remember the hot and sweaty drives to the beachside&#160;caravan park. In some form, the road trip has long been&#160;a part of the Australian psyche: the highway to nowhere, that endless beat stream of consciousness, fleeting places stitched together as an unfolding narrative, destination unknown, driving for the experience of the journey itself. Like the iconic tagline from <em>Easy Rider</em>, a man went in search of America, but never found it.</p><p>This romantic vision is rendered in a uniquely Australian way in <em>Emoh Ruo</em>, the Australian exhibition for the International Showcase at the London Festival of Architecture. The beat-poet ramble is replaced by the kids in the back seat screaming, the flea-bitten motel by the fibro holiday home, the wild rolling highway by the rhythm of vernacular town signs that mark the edge of aspirational communities. These same signs are the exhibition\u2019s framing device.</p><p>Curated under the theme of \u201cThe Welcoming City\u201d, <em>Emoh Ruo</em> is a tour of Australian architecture along three tracts \u2013 the vernacular, the built and the speculative. The exhibition is modestly housed in the corridor of the Bridge Gallery in Westminster, a fitting transition space, a microcosm of the highways and byways that the exhibition catalogues. This cold, fluorescent London corridor is tinted with a sweet nostalgia for the signs and iconography of the small towns I remember passing through on my own school holiday road trips. The three built projects in the exhibition are all sited along the Australian road network. The sculptural icons of DCM\u2019s gateway to Melbourne; the Craigieburn Bypass by Tonkin Zulaikha Greer, Taylor Cullity Lethlean and Robert Owen; and the Heide Museum\u2019s Helmut landscape sculpture by Cassandra Chilton and Tanya Court all form iconic city gates and boundaries, signifying aspirations of place-making rather than being places in themselves.</p><p>This collection of signs also marks the journey through a global atlas of speculative projects by six invited Australian architects. Like a bag of mixed lollies one gets from a petrol station pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, it is an intriguing assortment of practices, from the big corporate office to the small and dynamic studio. Melbourne firm Minifie Nixon takes us on a tour through Mildura with a miscellany of small, catalytic projects scattered about the city \u2013 an island resort, a street orchard, an academic retreat and a sporting paradise anchor islands of intensity around which the rural city can grow. Similarly, the small design studio Point Supreme identifies and remakes the hills of Athens in an effort to rebrand the city as a destination in itself, rather than just a departure point for island hoppers. The Eco Hill, Cultural Hill, Olympic Hill and Wildlife Hill all form a new topography of urban events embedded in the grain of the ancient city. Large corporate firm Hassell has choreographed its own landscape journey through three site-specific pavilions for Rottnest Island off the coast of Western Australia. The first station point is tuned to frame the horizon, the second surveys the terrain from the island\u2019s high point, and the third is a floating pontoon in the calm waters of a protected beach. In Ljubljana, Solvenia, Kokkugia, a small design studio fragmented between London and New York, has been studying the retail patterns, pedestrian networks and morphology of its locations\u2019 urban landscapes to form a glossy tectonic field of public and retail space.</p><p>As with the vernacular signs marking city limits, what is common to each of these projects is both a modesty of scale and a commitment to the understanding and making of place. Rather than render an image of the contemporary Australian architectural landscape in itself, the exhibition presents place specificity as a methodology and a discourse. It is a practice of violent sensitivity that seems to run against the grain of the international office and its current mode of closed and inward-looking technique-based research. It seems that from our isolated island at the bottom of the world comes a methodology that is both unfashionable and unexpected. Like a strange, flightless bird on the Galapagos, the place-specific architecture that is iconic in Australia continues to evolve. The persistence of this strange, lumbering beast we call genius loci, the clich\u00e9 of place, the touch-the-earth-lightly mantra is perhaps what makes us quite unique and, possibly, quite cool, but it still seems too elementary to be the dominant speculative agenda.</p><p>Collectively titled \u201cspeculative\u201d in <em>Emoh Ruo</em>, these place-specific works perhaps read more as unbuilt projects than as speculations. Speculation presupposes a project based in experiment and conjecture, not fact and investigation. Both the corporate offices of Hassell and BVN and the smaller experimental studios of Point Supreme and Kokkugia are operating from within the same agenda of site investigation and place making. As one scans across the projects, it is not easy to distinguish either type of practice from the other. This inclusive spectrum of firms makes more apparent the question of where it is that we may find a speculative Australian architecture. Is there room in Australian architecture for speculation that extends beyond narratives of place?</p><p>In a United Kingdom context of recession chic, when all of the current discussion is about the possibilities of not building, it is intriguing to see an exhibition from a place with such unrelenting growth that chooses to focus on unbuilt work. In a country that is still building, are there opportunities for projecting our identity through speculative experiments in built works? The possibility for projecting an alternate discourse of speculating through making is an engaging one. From this exhibition in London, we see our home looming large behind us, reversed in the rear-view mirror. <em>Emoh Ruo</em> is committed to presenting Australian architecture as a global traveller. The spirit of the Australian road trip, however, is not just the spirit of place. As with the speculative project, the road trip promises the unknown as it privileges risk and bold new experiences. What this international showcase does do is something Australian architecture should be doing much more often \u2013 packing the bags, filling up the tank, laying down the rubber road and heading out there. But perhaps we can be much more adventurous about what we do along the way.</p><p><strong><em>Liam Young</em> is a London-based urbanist, designer and co-founder of Tomorrow\u2019s Thoughts Today (tomorrowsthoughtstoday.com).</strong></p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>In her winning essay for SONA\u2019s SAC Sustainability Essay Competition, Gillian Hatch proposes that swimming pool aquaculture might yield a sustainable solution for the suburbs.</strong></p><p>At first glance, the Geelong suburb of Newtown (approximate population 9,800) does not appear disadvantaged, a suburb for the middle classes with an average annual taxable income of $46,584 per person (compared to $37,055 for the neighbouring suburb of Geelong West).<sup>1</sup> Centrally located within the Greater City of Geelong, it is close to schools and shopping areas and has several supermarkets within its boundaries. It could be argued, therefore, that Newtown is close to food resources. However, it is not close to areas of food production and, as the populations of both Melbourne and Geelong and the areas that surround them continue to grow, this distance increases. Population growth and expansion have eaten into the food production areas that surround Geelong \u2013 particularly Werribee and the Surf Coast.</p><p>This growing distance suggests a need to find other food resources, and looking at a map of Geelong, another potential food source becomes apparent \u2013 the sea, namely Corio Bay. This view suggests that fisheries could play a significant part in the food supply for Newtown residents. However, as James David Smith notes, Geelong\u2019s role as an industrial hub and as the largest port in regional Victoria has had significant environmental effects, which limit the feasibility and safety of using this area as a major food source.<sup>2</sup> Despite this, the idea of using a body of water for local food production forms the beginning of my proposal.</p><p>A Google Maps aerial view reveals that at least a quarter of the backyards in Newtown\u2019s Skene Street contain swimming pools. Zooming out, it becomes apparent that this phenomenon applies across Newtown. But an ageing population (15.6 percent of its residents were aged over sixty-five, compared with 13 percent Australia-wide in 2007) has meant that swimming pool use decreases as children move out and maintenance costs increase.<sup>3</sup> So, how might disused and under-used pools in Newtown be used to decrease distance from food production zones? Put simply, I propose utilizing these spaces as urban-scale agricultural zones for residents to reduce pressure on existing agricultural areas and reduce the need to relocate resources to serve this urban environment.</p><p>Backyard pools that are no longer in use provide three conditions \u2013 sunlight, water and constant water circulation \u2013 that create an optimal environment for aquaculture, the cultivation of aquatic life in controlled settings. Essentially this proposal involves the community farming fish on a small scale, a technique that is thought to have been in use for thousands of years, with evidence suggesting that Victoria\u2019s Gunditjmara people raised eels as early as 6000 BC.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Fish selection is important. Tilapia, the common name for species from the tilapiine cichlid tribe, is a popular fish for small-scale farming, especially in developing nations, because of its large size, rapid growth and palatability and the ease with which it can be farmed.<sup>5</sup> Its herbivore diet mainly consists of plankton, filamentous algae, aquatic macrophytes and other vegetable matter. This diet allows fish to be fed simply by maintaining their environment and it also means that the fish don\u2019t accumulate toxins in their bodies as carnivorous fish species do. This species is also appropriate for Geelong\u2019s climatic conditions.</p><p>Once the site has been prepared, the pool can be stocked with young tilapia, allowing for two to three mature fish per square metre of water surface. The fish require consistent algae production in the pool to survive. The addition of fertilizer to the pool can be used to achieve this but, for production to be sustainable, it is essential that another process is found. A suitable option is integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), a process in which the waste produced from one species is recycled to become food for another.<sup>6</sup></p><p>Community contribution would be particularly important when the tilapia reach maturity at ten months. Harvesting would require participants to fish the tilapia from the pool using a net, to process and distribute the fish and to restock the pond. I would hope that this work would act as a model of community engagement for other groups in a similar way to CERES, a community environment park in Brunswick.<sup>7</sup> This scheme could be used to increase knowledge and interest in sustainability within the community and encourage other forms of urban agriculture.</p><p>The proposal also provides new employment opportunities to people within Geelong \u2013 the city suffers high unemployment, especially among the young (8.6 percent compared to Australia\u2019s average of 5.1 percent).<sup>8</sup> Employment opportunities would include the installation and maintenance of these systems as well as the harvesting of the fish; and skills training could be offered by the nearby Gordon Institute of TAFE. On a community scale, implementing this system would reduce the need to transport food over great distances, decreasing the environmental effects of travel and storage and reducing pressure on the dwindling supply of wild fish stocks.</p><p>Per capita, Australia builds more domestic swimming pools than any other country in the world. The United States, with its population of 270 million, installs 90,000 new pools annually; Australia, with its population of 20 million, and 800,000 existing pools, installs 20,000.<sup>9</sup></p><p>So if the size of an average Australian pool is sixty square metres and two to three mature tilapia can inhabit each square metre of water surface and there are 800,000 existing pools, we have 60 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 800,000 ...<sup>10</sup></p><p>Think about this number in fish ...</p><p><strong>Gillian Hatch is a third-year architecture student at RMIT University.

            "content": "<p><strong>The Australian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale is now open. Carey Lyon reflects on the Now + When exhibition.</strong></p><p>It is difficult to separate a review of Now + When from&#160;the expectations built up through advanced publicity \u2013 part necessary promotional strategies and part rather excessive boosterism. Much of this advanced press focused on the new technologies being trialled (complete with action photos of one of the creative directors leaning out of a helicopter) and the promise, quite literally, of a spectacle. Conversely, the sixteen exhibitors within the When component of the exhibition hovered somewhat below the promotional radar, inviting curiosity about the exhibition\u2019s content. The promise of a spectacle seemed to be offered as a calculated polemical position by the creative directors in relation to the two previous Australian Pavilion exhibitions in 2006 and 2008, which were summarized as \u201cacademic\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d in various dispatches and interviews. This is not to suggest that the 2010 show was primarily constructed as an opposite \u2013 \u201caccessible\u201d and \u201cspectacular\u201d \u2013 however, it did convey an interest in the relationship between architecture and new media; if not an idea about the blockbuster, then at least a serious interest in the box office receipts.</p><p>All of which, for your reviewer, made for both curiosity, scepticism and trepidation in entering the blackened pavilion on a hot and humid Venice morning. It has to be said that from the first disorienting blackened interior, with a physically immersive soundscape (by Nick Murray and Carl Anderson), the concept of the spectacle succeeds in all the ways intended. Weary biennale visitors on the national pavilions trail within the Giardini can have an immediate media fix in the space of a ten- or fifteen-minute stay, as a passive participant if they choose. Stand still with 3D glasses attached and the content comes to and indeed at you. Unexpectedly, this structured passivity of the visitor creates a meditative quality for the Now part of the experience. It invites you to participate in the spectacle as a kind of media event and also to step into its stereoscopic world.</p><p>So what is it that we see? The actual technical achievements of the stereoscopic images are difficult to evaluate, but as we are all now dedicated and relatively sophisticated consumers of new media, its immediate and explicit novelty passes quickly. Nevertheless, the Now images are extraordinary to stand in front of and, in fact, to see inside of, due to the technology itself. The images taken at dusk of Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast are brought alive by the stereoscopic process \u2013 pulsing and teeming, simultaneously intensely beautiful as a human enterprise and shocking as the visceral intensity of the energy burn jumps out of the screen toward you. The parallel images of the open-cut mines from remote Western Australia also have a terrible beauty in the scarified landscapes, yawning scars for the doubting Thomases of environmental havoc. Carved out by access roads, these mine images have an almost mythical, even biblical, quality \u2013 like ruins of a lost civilization, or a wizened Tower of Babel as a harbinger of catastrophe.</p><p>The juxtaposition of the city-scapes with the mine-scapes is not subtle (it certainly isn\u2019t \u201cacademic\u201d) but it is powerful and creates an interesting disruption in one\u2019s mind. Like a well-made thirty-second ad it gets its message across (cuts through, to use media jargon) \u2013 lest we forget where our cities come from, like the slaughterhouse to the supermarket shelf. Within the Australian context it takes that to which we are culturally blind, the \u201cother\u201d of our interior, and transposes it dramatically as a paired equal to our everyday fringe-dwelling existence. This artificially constructed mutuality can be held clearly in our minds and eyes through the joining of the message with the media.</p><p>It also invites us to contemplate whether there is still some resonance in the Marshall McLuhan paradigm that the media is the message. This may be a subtext to the creative directors\u2019 primary interests and it seems to propose that the technique itself (stereoscopic imagery) might offer architects and urbanists a new way of both seeing and representing. With earlier representational tools such as plans and sections now heading for redundancy, and parametric modelling lurching towards ubiquity, you get the feeling, standing with your 3D glasses on in the pavilion, that you are looking into another paradigm shift in technique. Embryonic and uncertain as this technique may be, it is a window into another way of seeing \u2013 and another way of seeing must eventually allow us to find another way to think about architecture and the city.</p><p>Whereas the Now images have the certainty of the existing world to provide a stable locus from which the new media can be contemplated, for the When component it becomes something else entirely \u2013 far more cinematic and unfamiliar. The creative directors have discussed the sixteen contributions by the various teams as something more than a direct speculation on the future of the city through environmental, geopolitical and population change, claiming a wider allegorical quality for the propositions. The resulting contributions require us to suspend disbelief, in the plausibility of each idea, and to participate in them as almost filmic imaginings of future worlds.</p><p>On the first run-through of the pavilion\u2019s twelve-minute video loop of the sixteen propositions, the allegories are, for the most part, pretty grim and foreboding. There is not a lot of optimism about these future dreams and quite a few nightmares \u2013 an effect compounded by joining each of the sixteen worlds together as a continuous loop, without a break or even a \u201creboot\u201d as we enter each new and distinctively authored world. Some of this may have been overcome by the creative directors exerting a stronger critical selection of the presentations, culling out enough to provide those with greater depth (intellectual as opposed to stereoscopic) more space to open up their worlds to us. Even in a practical sense, sixteen exhibitors over a twelve-minute loop is not a lot of time in the sun for what looked like a hell of a lot of work by each contributor.</p><p>A number of exhibitors took the creative directors\u2019 brief rather literally, generating straightforward, reactive strategies to the prospect of massive change, particularly to the consequences of rising sea levels. Many of these imagined worlds offer little more than future cities of so many data-scapes (tower equals population density), or simply maintain the professional niceties of the urban planning discipline in spite of what would be, in the scenario of the biblical flood, surely more visceral and more physically catastrophic \u2013 like Lake Pedder or the 2005 tsunami. Even with the best efforts by exhibition animators (Flood Slicer), a number of these schemes come across as anodyne.</p><p>Within this genre, however, a couple of schemes stand out as notable exceptions, primarily by conveying a sense of the city\u2019s capacity for adaption rather than reaction. Saturation City (by McGauran Giannini Soon, Bild + Dyksors and Material Thinking) heightens the sense of catastrophe by connecting it to familiar yet radically altered typologies \u2013 positioning Melbourne\u2019s Shrine of Remembrance in a strange sunken island and generating immense floating megastructures made out of piled up suburban houses, at once ordinary and shockingly dislocated. Symbiotic City (by Steve Whitford and James Brearley) similarly expands the idea of adaption, with the City of Hobart reinventing itself around the urban detritus of catastrophe, and with a curious overlay of the Asian metropolis, as though, in a dramatic realignment through climate change, the tropical equator has shifted closer to Antarctica.</p><p>Admirably outside of this genre of reaction, and far closer to the concept of allegory, is Sedimentary City (by Brit Andresen and Mara Francis). It conspicuously avoids the idea that massive change carries with it the certainty of disruption and erosion by focusing on the continuity of the city as a series of stratified layers of time and culture. Change, even massive change, does bring another layer encrusted over others, but it also illuminates what lies beneath it, with the Brisbane River as a line of physical stability. It\u2019s worth the price of the catalogue just to look at these astonishing drawings \u2013 which are curiously disembowelled in the three-dimensional video by the separation of layers that need to be read together \u2013 asserting (for those who care) a hopeful future for two dimensions.</p><p>The most useful exploration of the fifty-year timeframe proposed as a speculative parameter by the creative directors, is Implementing the Rhetoric (by Harrison and White with Nano Langenheim). This offers a series of complex but entirely plausible strategies. It brings real underlying intelligence \u2013 a kind of practical iconoclasm \u2013 to the everyday, unchanging needs of cities: density, light and amenity.</p><p>Outside of this savvy realism, City of Hope (by Edmond and Corrigan) is perhaps the only entry that truly operates in the allegorical realm that the creative directors intended, as a type of extended metaphor or, at its furthest reach, like a parable. This hopeful world, entirely local in its geography (replete with a helpful locality map), is an allegory of rebirth, of regeneration, and an affirmation of what we know \u2013 as if to say that even with dramatic climate change, there will still be a spring. Their short catalogue text could be seen to be addressing a number of fellow exhibitors: \u201cIf in this turmoil we lose sight of our identity, we will sacrifice what is essential in us to our projection of the future. We should not sacrifice everything to the panic of our times.\u201d</p><p>By any fair assessment Now + When offers a great deal to visitors, whether participating passively with the spectacle of its media, contemplating the Faustian pact between the media and the message, or digging into the content of the schemes that illuminate a hopeful When.</p><p><em>Carey Lyon</em> is a director of Lyons.</p><h6>Images of all exhibited schemes are presented in <em>Architecture Australia</em> vol 99 no 5, September/October 2010.

Rachel Hurst reflects on the Now + When exhibition.</strong></strong></p><p>Waiting in the queue to enter the enigmatic black box of the Australian Pavilion at this year\u2019s Venice Biennale is a little like waiting in line at a 1980s nightclub. The buzz of expectation is there, the cues are encouraging \u2013 funky fluorescent orange lettering spelling out Now+When, gorgeously tricky catalogue with optical effects, and efficient door bitches marshalling patrons and handing out bright orange show bags. But also the anxiety that when you get in, there will be no-one there and the music will be all Depeche Mode or, worse, Duran Duran. The nostalgia continues inside, the pitch black of the two-level space illuminated dramatically by ultraviolet light and dazzling stereoscopic animated installations, curated by John Gollings and Ivan Rijavec. A soundscape by Nick Murray and Carl Anderson, at chest-reverberating volume, completes the setting.</p><p>Happily there are plenty of \u201cclubbers\u201d on the three occasions I visit during the Vernissage, moving gingerly through the space to the viewing positions dictated by suspended 3D spectacles. All are absorbed, not only in the camaraderie created by the dark, the funny glasses and the real risk of garrotting their neighbour with their spectacle cords, but more genuinely by the immersive experience and brilliant spectacle of the work on show.</p><p>The first component of the pavilion, Now, presents a vivid comparison between the urban edge and the mineral centre of Australia. Panoramas of Sydney, Melbourne and Surfers Paradise, glittering in a bling of night-time illumination, contrast profoundly with images of mining holes in the western outback. Beautiful and terrible at once, these gaping cuts in the landscape are paradoxically reminiscent of contemporary Indigenous depictions of intact native territory, and for many the most compelling images of the installation. Reviewer for The Australian Robert Bevan, in his unduly disparaging critique of Now + When, found the juxtaposition lacking in nuance, encapsulating what he called \u201cthe complacency of commercial design\u201d. Though the environmental message may be so blunt as to be overly simplified, it illustrates the undeniable ambiguity of what constitutes beauty in an Australian context.</p><p>The second part, When, stitches sixteen separate visions for Australian cities in 2050 and beyond into a continuous 3D film. Each contribution is shown for thirty-eight seconds, without written or audio narrative. As the contributors are not identified in the film, viewers need to read brief synopses on the wall to identify schemes, prompting a kind of \u201cguess-who-did-what\u201d game among the architectural aficionados in the audience. The exhibited teams represent a broad cross-section of both architectural practice and academic partnerships, and the inclusivity of the curation is commendable, if only for encouraging a large contingent of Australian supporters. The ideas provide a diversity of fantastic macro-scaled schemes, consistent with the call from the curators to reimagine whole cities as \u201curban theatrical propositions ... free from the tedium of current urban debate\u201d.</p><p>These are futuristic, fanciful and seductive speculations and, like most crystal ball gazing, require a willing suspension of disbelief \u2013 not just in temporal and technological achievability, but also in reading of scale. For example, Terra Form Australis shows skyscrapers with heights equivalent to the length of Tasmania to illustrate its thought-provoking proposal for densification around an artificial interior coastline. Exaggerated verticality seems, if not obligatory, then pervasive \u2013 it\u2019s the dynamic, optimistic axis visually, and these are unashamedly optimistic projections. Similarly, most of the scenarios emphasize transport, circulation and connectivity. This is most likely the result of digital animation being the sole representational mode: animations are essentially about movement, after all. What is disconcerting, however, is the homogeneous, almost leaden pace of the fly-throughs, a pace reinforced by the music, which threatens to undermine the up-beat nature of the visuals with its ominous undertones. Concepts and music flow in seamless time and space, inducing, perhaps intentionally, a hypnotic, \u201cconscious dreaming\u201d state. Though this heightens sensory sublimation in the observer, it also makes differentiation and genuine critical engagement with the ideas difficult. Elsewhere, Sarah Treadwell has described this effect as a \u201cform of cerebral paralysis induced by the flaccid movement [of fly-throughs] that registers neither agitation nor its termination.\u201d<sup>1 </sup>She notes that fly-throughs tend to \u201cconstruct ground as smoothly pictorial\u201d and despite the weight of rendering (which in Now + When is consistently impressive), \u201cseem not to get caught up in considerations of gravity.\u201d A loosened foothold on the earth may be an inevitable consequence of the fly-through, and this is tackled in a number of ways by various schemes: the floating metropolises of the Avatar-blue Oceanic City and earnest cellular composition of Saturation City, the hovering horizons and billowing urban quilts of Multiplicity and How Does It Make You Feel?. Only a minority, like the layered grainy collages of Sedimentary City, focus explicitly on \u201cground\u201d as a defining element of the Australian setting, though it is accentuated by Now\u2019s outback vistas. The number of schemes that deal with gravitas are arguably fewer \u2013 even those depicting post-apocalypse scenarios, like the stern inhabited aqueducts of Aquatown and sci-fi comic images of Mould City, are buoyant predictions for future livability.</p><p>At the opening of the pavilion, Rijavec likened the other-worldly depictions of some of the schemes to the immediate context of Venetian architecture \u2013 the ethereal imaginary realms of baroque frescoed ceilings and Italian religious art. Like those precedents, When uses transcendent images to project beyond the turmoil of the everyday, to inspire hope and belief in some higher authority who will solve the dire problems of the present. The mesmerizing glimpses of heaven that the consummate technicians of seventeenth-century trompe l\u2019oeil, such as Tiepolo and Andrea Pozzo, were able to conjure in the service of both celestial and earthly versions of Christian authority were undeniably a form of propaganda. One might ask if a similar task remains for contemporary architects, to provide equivalent comfort and hope. Inspiration \u2013 yes; spin doctoring \u2013 probably not, if the tenor of the rest of the biennale can be used to judge, for along with the expected array of exquisite, inventive \u201cbig projects\u201d, director Kazuyo Sejima\u2019s curation elicited an unmistakable preoccupation with sensitive but pragmatic problem solving, rigorous analysis and re-evaluation of traditional modes.</p><p>Moreover, like the theatrical creations of the baroque, When has an undeniable obsession with striking formality and compositional consistency, whether based in crystalline, biomorphic or good old-fashioned architectonic language. Other stakeholders in urbanism \u2013 planners, social demographers, ecologists, et cetera \u2013 might argue that that is a misrepresentation of how good urbanism is generated, but the associations provoked by the schemes are rich. There is everything from Renaissance and Beaux-Arts ideal city plans in the gorgeous psychosexual pastiche of Edmond and Corrigan\u2019s City of Hope to twentieth-century delineator Hugh Ferris\u2019s futuristic utopias in Fraying Ground, to glossy sex toys (no names, no pack drill), in varying degrees of appeal, fascination or good taste. The collection is a visual smorgasbord of contemporary ideologies, architectural languages and representations, and if there are accusations of derivative imagery \u2013 of Archigram, Superstudio, Coop Himmelblau, Lebbeus Woods or (according to Bevan) MVRDV \u2013 then the Australian exhibition was by no means alone. Within the fervent drive of the whole biennale event to display the latest new thing is the glaring recognition of how hard it really is to do something genuinely original. Along with the selection of the modest, craft-based pavilion of Bahrain as Golden Lion winner and Sejima\u2019s curation generally, this raises the question: why not concentrate on doing unoriginal better?</p><p>The biennale\u2019s benevolent mantle People Meet in Architecture is curiously hard to identify in Now + When, despite this being a \u2013 the \u2013 critical aspect of good urbanism. Only a few animations were populated with plausible human activity of any detail or intimacy. Ironically, it was the rigmarole of negotiating the space and 3D spectacles that picked up the theme in a relaxed manner, unlike some of the more didactic, hands-off pavilions or those that forced deliberate interaction. A legitimate defence is that the curation and content of the Australian entry was determined before Sejima\u2019s theme was announced. Any informed urbanist, however, knows the perils of macro-planning without attention at the pedestrian, people level of cities. Michel de Certeau warns against taking a distant view of the city and becoming \u201can Icarus flying above [the] waters, (who) can ignore the devices of Daedalus in mobile and endless labyrinths far below.\u201d<sup>2</sup> So is it the fly-through and its divorce from the ground plane that is responsible for the dearth of engaging human activity in the When anthology? Or is it a mismatch between the desire for spectacular visionary concepts expected of contributors and the essentially conservative nature of how we occupy real cities?</p><p>Perhaps my disappointment at the lack of demonstration of the on-the-ground benefits of all these courageous proposals was heightened by spending three days beforehand in the fine-grained city of Padova, trying to observe and record what makes it such a vibrant, satisfying place. Crucially, more than a quarter of its population are students, but physically the city delights with its balance between typological constancy, expressive individuality and intimate human scale, at every irregular corner and warped turn of the street. The immediate setting of Venice also provides a relevant critique of Now + When, as it did for many of the pavilions in the biennale (notably the UK\u2019s Villa Frankenstein, which used Ruskin\u2019s The Stones of Venice as a pivotal ideological launching point). Venice is a city founded on a big idea, an initial imaginative leap of faith which remains both lucid and ludicrous to this day. Yet what makes it the city to inspire the likes of Ruskin, Calvino and the twenty million tourists who visit it each year is the close detail, the incremental, worn, idiosyncratic manipulation of that overarching template which enriches urban experience at the walking, talking, sitting, eating, watching, human level. If this aspect of urbanity was underplayed in some of the work on show, so too was the sense of any regional inflection. Apart from background settings of the major Australian cities, many schemes could have been strategies for anywhere. Notable exceptions were Terra Form Australis, Sedimentary City \u2013 the scheme with the (shamingly) singular direct reference to Indigenous occupation \u2013 and the Melbourne\u2013Hobart bridge of Island Proposition 2100. Positive spin would use this as evidence of Australia\u2019s international perspective and interest in solutions with global application. Bevan\u2019s critique, however, saw it as out of step with prevailing preoccupations with contracted, localized, interstitial, place-specific architectural advocacy.</p><p>But if the bravura and downright fun of the Australian pavilion lacked some of the poignant gentle observations of others, at least it wasn\u2019t earnestly pedagogical in the manner of the French or Danish contributions, which were serious one-stop condensed courses in urban design. I am not convinced by Rijavec\u2019s confident statement at the opening that the When proposals \u201clack the sanitized perfectionist depictions of other exhibits\u201d, given the gleaming, fastidious nature of most of the Australian schemes. They are, however, blatantly entertaining. Maybe I misheard him in the euphoric buzz of opening morning ...</p><p>These criticisms aren\u2019t intended to be carping. The Now + When exhibition is a slick and intelligent snapshot of Australia and its architectural capabilities, with evident concerns for urbanity, environment, climate and place. As a biennale \u201cvirgin\u201d and architectural educator, I found the event sensational, literally and intellectually, and probably one of the most intense and effective forms of professional development any architect could undertake. Now + When, with its stunning immersive impact, would undoubtedly have thrilled those in a position to add financial support to the continuation of this important event, and its internalized black-box approach countered the outdated dreariness of the building itself, which sits poorly against most other pavilions in the Giardini. Many of these are worth architectural detours in themselves, no matter what is displayed inside. As John Wardle quipped, \u201cmy favourite pavilion is Venezuela and I can\u2019t even get in there!\u201d The next step perhaps is to have a building, maintenance and support program which tangibly demonstrates Australia\u2019s architectural presence and substance, and that is worthy of the efforts of Gollings, Rijavec et al.

            "content": "<p><strong>The Australian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale is now open. Mirjana Lozanovska comments on the Biennale as a whole.</strong></p><p>It is easy to be cynical about the spectacle and extravaganza&#160;of the Venice Biennale. When the paparazzi surrounded Sejima and Nishizawa for their conversation with film director Wim Wenders, thoughts of Hollywood and the \u201cstarchitect\u201d became real and visible. And yet this cynicism is superficial because as an architectural community we have put value on Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Barcelona Pavilion and Konstantin Melnikov\u2019s Russian Pavilion, produced in similar forums. It is easy also to be horrified by the excessive tourism in a city like Venice, and yet this tourism is partly an outcome of the profound and compelling literature and cinema that, as tourists, we carry with us on our way to such cities. Globalization and the consumption of culture do not easily divide the beautiful from the grotesque, the valuable from the trivial, and architecture like all other cultural productions finds itself swept up by people\u2019s desires and fictions.</p><p>These are just two threads of the theme of the 2010 Venice Architecture Biennale, People Meet in Architecture, developed by Japanese architect Kazuyo Sejima. Explicit criticism in architecture journals about the recent lack of architectural focus of the biennale were put aside in anticipation of a director who is an exemplary architect, who was awarded the 2010 Pritzker prize (in partnership with Ryue Nishizawa, SANAA). Sejima\u2019s theme is not unlike her way of speaking English or her mode of architectural design \u2013 qualified by a linguistic and spatial openness. And yet with characteristic thinness and linearity, it firmly inscribes an aesthetic position and an agenda that is not blurred, even if open.</p><p>National and architectural firm participants exhibiting in the Corderie dell\u2019Arsenale, the old brick buildings of the ropemaking factory of the Venetian navy, were asked to express the character of the existing space in their projects. In this sense, the architects are the people as they encounter existing architecture. Displaying the components and materials used in their workplace \u2013 1:1-scale facade sections, stone components, tiles, colour samples and many models \u2013 Studio Mumbai Architects produced a weighty presence of the matter that engaged the viewer corporeally. A range of models, from small shapes literally thumb-printed to large-scale models testing the digital geometry, circulation and structure, and images of the 1:1 construction model, presented the design process of Toyo Ito\u2019s Taichung Metropolitan Opera House. Both these exhibits engendered the viewer as architect because these were not artefacts remade for exhibition but the tool kit of the architect.</p><p>Also playing with the idea of the architect was the Japanese Pavilion in the Giardini \u2013 a fully detailed dwelling and studio space at doll\u2019s scale. Because the structure was suspended in a void in the floor, the viewer was invited to enter from below such that their head peered into the space, and then from above on the next level. It was enchanting and contrasted with their other component, which explored the 26-year life cycle of buildings in Tokyo in response to the 50-year anniversary of metabolism. In the Palazzo delle Esposizioni della Biennale, the collaboration between artist Do-Ho Suh and Suh Architects created an artistic mediation of house, home and architectural representation. Entitled \u201cBlueprint\u201d, it comprised a blue -tinged elevation drawing of layered facades (the artist\u2019s house in Korea, his New York townhouse residence, and a typical Venetian villa), which was placed on the floor and constructed from laminate panels that were rubber -soft underfoot. This was reflected by a translucent, blue, gauze-like fabric suspended from the ceiling, meticulously patterned and hand-sewn to form a 1:1 reproduction of a facade (the New York townhouse) in relief, such that indentations were to scale. If cerebral ideas about memory, shadows and representation could be transferred into experience, this installation came close. Other pavilions (Russian and Dutch) explored this theme of the architectural presence of the past through the plight of many existing unused buildings, especially industrial buildings \u2013 beautiful and yet left vacant or demolished.</p><p>The pavilions of Estonia and the Republic of Macedonia produced a white field of housing typology (Estonia) and spatial situations (Macedonia) that visually contrasted the aged masonry at the Arsenale, and presented the idea of \u201cmany\u201d people in architecture. Under the creative guidance of Minas Bakalcev and Mitko Hadzi-Pulja (MBMHP), the Macedonian pavilion, Learning Architecture, presented the results of 101 first-year students. Each student developed a program and space for three people, generating many \u201cpeople\u2013architecture\u201d situations. At the opening, sixty-five students in red T-shirts joined hands and encircled the large white field, illuminated by the light from three arched windows. This was inspired by the \u201coro\u201d, a traditional dance that through ritual produces a primal and primeval space of individuals in a collective shape. Architecture as white field is always animated and created by human subject(s) as one and many, and in the final model expressed in the trace of black shadow figures.</p><p>It is because I enjoyed so much of the biennale that the awarding of the Golden Lion for best national pavilion to the Kingdom of Bahrain was perplexing, especially as two of the judges might have had a different impression. The pavilion presented three \u201cfishermen\u2019s huts\u201d, described by the team as \u201carchitecture without architects\u201d, purchased and reconstructed in the Arsenale \u2013 contradictions already announced in this huge task supported by huge finances \u2013 against their evident popularity as resting haven. Some Bahrainis are deeply concerned about the sea in which their island is located. Not many, because the actions and realities are testimony to a different history of oil, urban development and land reclamation, making the \u201cwe\u201d in the text confusing. More contradictions. This exhibit is a trace of a lament for a romanticized past that possibly did not exist. The problematic representation of others might have been overlooked if a potent poetics proposed a different future. However, the proposal is for a new waterfront strategy, one promoted by a fashionable global economy of cultural tourism. How and whether such \u201cfishermen\u2019s huts\u201d would feature or survive in this new agenda is not explored in the exhibition. The huts have become by default artefacts in a museum, announcing the end of their spontaneous construction.</p><p>It is not an easy task to produce architectural exhibits. They run the risk of being too visual and trying to be art or graphics, or too representational and textual, or just too abstract and/or confusing. In 2010 participants answered Sejima\u2019s call and produced pavilions and exhibits that were experiential, spatial and corporeal. Many inspire new ways of doing architecture and leave you with much to think about. </p><p><em>Mirjana Lozanovska</em> is a senior lecturer in architecture at&#160;Deakin University. </p>",

Elegant glass rooms at street level give no indication of the experiential nature of the journey to follow. These stations are designed to prioritize the efficient movement of people while maintaining an evocative architectural environment. The entry room is a cleverly balanced, top-lit volume occupied simply by three elements of vertical access: stair, escalator and lift. These elements appear as sculptures within a space which is free of ornamentation, beautifully ordered and reliant only on light and people to colour the architecture. The entry hall below is an elegant, asymmetrical, double-loaded volume that combines simple but effective scheduling with easy movement through to the centralized, singular, ticketed gates. Access down onto the train platforms is equally direct, with relative reductions in scale as one descends the final of nine levels into the horizontal tunnel zone. Finishes are modified here to reflect the nature of a train environment and the management of a corrosive and fire environment. The entire project presents a remarkable clarity. There is restraint within the material palette and a clever adjustment of both space and functional finishes as one descends from street to train line, along with a genuinely visionary approach to station management and work environments. This all contributes to a project of unusual competence and beauty that derives its architecture from common sense with sensitive design decisions.</p><h6>For full coverage see <em>Architecture Australia</em> vol 98 no 3, May/June 2009.</h6>",

The project brings order to a complex brief, organizing planning to enable flexibility and delineated functional movement throughout the building. The entry foyer is a mighty space that manages scale with merit and ease, the sculpturally articulated auditorium wall contributes a sense of art and the glazed wall to the city provides a tough, definite edge to adjacent land and river. The elaborate array of internal finishes is a constant source of stimulation and decoration throughout the building. They offer a unique artistic licence rarely found to this extent within the fitout of a large public building. The plenary hall is a magnificent room. Reminiscent of Aalto\u2019s lecture halls, it can be subdivided to make three smaller, fully sound-isolated auditoriums. Flexibility is increased further with the installation of fully automated gala seating and staging that can be lowered to extend the flat performance space. This building speculates on the future of convention centres, integrating art, sustainable systems and operational flexibility as key considerations. Unquestionably a building of urban presence, the Convention Centre builds upon Melbourne\u2019s knowledge of artistically infused, sculptured buildings.</p><h6>For full coverage see <em>Artichoke</em> 29.</h6>",

Planning is driven \u201coff the back\u201d of an innovative glazed thermal green wall. The building employs this southern facade to provide soft light and aspect over a small formalized park on all above-ground levels. Planning is unpredictable. The library is located on basement and ground level, making it easily accessible to the public, and community services and childcare are on the upper levels. A laneway adjacent to adjoining shops provides vertical access and, along with the spiral library stair, creates spatial zones that both link and contrast the horizontal work environments. There is conspicuous refinement in both planning strategies and detail. Junctions, alignments and set-outs communicate a high level of coordination and, in general, the selection of materials confirms that approach. This building could be likened to a refined machine, and the bespoke sun control louvre system to the street and park beyond contributes another layer of integrated technology to the workings of the building.

This is a response to site topography, to much needed site remediation, and represents architecture integral to the business proposition. The curved and barrel building forms derive from the rolling hills of the site and, in the tradition of the European wine chateau, serve to integrate all functions. From restaurant to wine tasting rooms, accommodation, laboratory, wine bottling and cellaring \u2013 all are wrapped in the rammed limestone walls of the building. Arrival is protected; the experience beyond is a secret to be revealed. The building is contemporary but rustic. Heavy timber portal frames radiate off the rammed limestone walls to form the main upper-level spaces for the public. Indeed, this limestone is the primary organizing element for the building; it screens the car park, denotes arrival, aids cellar conditions and is the material with which all other materials are either combined or contrasted throughout. But it is the building\u2019s relationship to the vineyard which is paramount, with rooms and functions organized around panoramic views of the estate hills and valleys. Materials are soft and warm and include exposed aggregate concrete floors and heavy timber structure, all contributing to the chateau ambience. This is a fine example of high quality architecture adding to the tourism vitality of a region.

From the beginning the architect and client worked together to understand the existing workplace culture and how they could function more effectively in a flexible, connected way. At 83,000 square metres, shared spaces are organized in and around the central atrium and include meeting rooms, breakout spaces and a 250-seat theatre. North- and south-facing office spaces also adjoin the atrium. Much thought has gone into wayfinding, the creation of destinations and the lengthening, framing and foreshortening of views to achieve human scale in what is otherwise a very large building. Objects and volumes in the atrium and the use of a mixture of materials have aided this outcome. Engineering solutions are impressively integrated into the whole, for example fire and smoke management allowing contiguous atrium and office floors. Floor displacement air is one of a range of initiatives that reduce the building\u2019s energy consumption. Water is recycled and stored and renewable energy generated. The end product is as much an exercise in human relations as it is architecture and the architects have created a flexible building for a business and for work practices that continue to change and adapt to the needs of this ANZ community at Docklands.</p>",

NMBW worked with their client to understand their workplace needs and the result is a relaxed environment that the practice can inhabit. What is unique about this project is that it begins with an understanding of the potential of the existing building, a former department store with generous floor-to-floor height and large windows in the masonry facade. Ceilings were removed and all services exposed in an unfussy way. Nothing is wasted in this low-budget fitout. Simple plywood-clad meeting rooms, meeting tables with trestle legs and concrete floors all come together to create a raw aesthetic that allows architects equitable access to daylight and spaces to interact, create and comfortably spread out their project workings. Several special pieces of furniture and commissioned artworks act as an elegant counterpoint to this rawness. Dark walls set off an otherwise standard low-cost services aesthetic, while bike racks and bikes in the foyer frame arrival from the lift. A true open-plan design studio, this fitout is a reflection of a strong social agenda by the practice directors. It is a simple, generous, sustainable solution that takes interior architecture to a new edge.</p><h6>For full coverage see <em>Artichoke</em> 31.</h6>",

Underpinning the work is a carefully researched understanding of the history of the site. This is a great public place because it respects the past without treating it as a museum artefact; it has spatial, material and planting variety; and it offers a model for the future redevelopment of the harbour foreshore. That industrial heritage is a useful part of the urban realm is a point of some contention in cities across the globe.

It is often claimed that high-rise buildings, particularly in hot climates, cannot be naturally ventilated, and that if we are to intensify urban density we are therefore doomed to inhabit closed, airconditioned glass boxes. The Met proves that claim wrong by creating tropical houses in the sky, with breezeways, outdoor living areas, planters, gardens and communal facilities on open-air terraces. Innovation and brilliant architectural strategic thinking answer extremely challenging climatic questions. In tropical and subtropical cities and many other urban conditions, high elevation offers more privacy, better views, lower humidity, stronger breezes and less noise and dust than street-level living. In The Met, WOHA has created enjoyable living conditions within an extremely high residential density \u2013 a plot ratio of 10:1 \u2013 by cleverly staggering the block arrangement to allow all apartments access to light and air on all four sides, enabling living without airconditioning. The sixty-six-storey form, of towers linked by sky terraces at every five storeys, creates a slender, light and porous lattice. Vertical facades are shaded by creeper screens rising up the full height, protecting the apartments and the dramatic yet human-scaled external spaces in the sky. Originality and beauty come together in The Met \u2013 a great solution to the issues of density in tropical Asian cities and, excitingly, a model directly translatable to many Australian cities.</p></p>",

The gently warping twisted shingled roof, the ordered plan, the simple palette of timber and stone, the calm of water and the restrained, consistent detailing combine to produce a house of rare beauty and serenity. Australia\u2019s growing international reputation for unique residential architecture that relates to landscape is further enhanced by this simple, elegant house that beautifully demonstrates the richness of cultural fusion.</p>",

In the dry savannah landscape of the Bukit Peninsula, the resort addresses two contemporary architectural concerns. The first is the way architecture might contribute to the development of an emerging luxury hotel genre. Hotels like the Alila Villas cater to design-savvy travellers seeking an ecologically sustainable, socially responsible holiday experience. The significant sustainability initiatives of this project embrace the passive and the active, the material and the social \u2013 including large overhangs and cross-ventilation, sewage treatment and sewage water recycling in a grey water system, and locally sourced materials and furnishings created by craftspeople from Java and Bali. The second concern is for the creation of an architecture that is both vernacular and modernist. Alila Villas has the atmosphere of traditional Balinese pavilion architecture and a reassuring internationalism that derives from a broad church of architectural references.</p><h6>For further coverage see <em>Architecture Australia</em> vol 99 no 5, Sept/Oct 2010.</h6>",

Any attempt at reconciling the diversity of what Philip Goad has described as the \u201carchipelago\u201d of Australian architectures is similarly fraught, when faced with the broad range of programs, contexts and concerns that have informed the projects. It\u2019s also unhelpful simply to reinforce the \u201crecognize and celebrate\u201d mandate of the Institute\u2019s awards program here.</p><p>We have, therefore, sought to bring another judgment to bear upon the awards, one brought from outside the processes of the day-to-day making of architecture. Ours is a perspective burdened instead with the difficulties of architecture\u2019s teaching and advocacy, a perspective attuned to engaged architectural methodology and to projects in which we see new modes of civic, cultural, political and domestic life.</p><p>This means that there are many impressive buildings in this year\u2019s national awards that won\u2019t be discussed here. We are interested in the projects that offer an intelligent, insightful commentary on contemporary social and cultural concerns. They demonstrate new modes of practice and advance an understanding of the architect as an agent for positive social, environmental and cultural change. Such projects are exemplars, promising reverberations in the future.</p><p><strong>Urban engagement</strong></p><p>In a departure from previous years, the public architecture award winners confront the challenges (and opportunities) of the city and its public realm. In this age of urbanization, there is clear evidence of the importance of architectural knowledge in resolving the complexities of infrastructure and civic projects set within the difficult fabric of our cities. The singularity of WOHA\u2019s proposal for their Bras Basah MRT station in Singapore \u2013 a water roof as lightwell, passive cooling device and reflection pool \u2013 is poetic, clever and sensitive to its historic context all at once. FJMT\u2019s compact social condenser \u2013 encompassing library, childcare and community facilities \u2013 shields its users from a busy inner-city street as well as providing a small urban park. Hassell\u2019s Rail Link Intermediate Stations use an understated architectural language as a dignified and generous introduction to the public transport network. The Melbourne Convention Centre, a joint venture between Woods Bagot and NH Architecture, occupies its piece of frayed urban fabric without displaying the unitary form of its near neighbour, Denton Corker Marshall\u2019s Melbourne Exhibition Centre. Instead it revels in the awkwardness of this fit, triangulating its urban form into sculptural interiors.</p><p><strong>Sustainability</strong></p><p>As well as the pressing concerns of the metropolis, there is an increasing focus on the environmental impacts of building. However, the sustainability category of the awards seems increasingly anachronistic. It hails from a time when environmental concerns were considered eccentric rather than mainstream and sets up the preposterous binary wherein projects from other categories would then be somehow \u201cunsustainable\u201d \u2013 an obvious nonsense. Sustainability is a catch-all for a broad range of concerns but is now widely accepted to form the basis of any definition of good design. The judges appear to share this ambivalence, awarding sustainability prizes to projects that had already been acknowledged in other categories as significant pieces of architecture. The breadth of possible engagement with the notion of sustainability is evident in the comparison of FJMT\u2019s technology-driven Surry Hills Library and Community Centre and NMBW\u2019s low-tech \u201cbuild less\u201d approach to their fitout of the Lyons Architecture Office. These divergent approaches both nevertheless result in projects of great generosity and eschew architectural asceticism.</p><p><strong>Palimpsest</strong></p><p>Notable interventions in the heritage category are bold rather than deferential and are sophisticated in their design approach. Using new insertions to celebrate the heritage of a site allows the past to make a far richer contribution to current cultural experience than the fastidious preservation of museum pieces. In both the Paddington Reservoir and the Barcaldine Memorial there is interrogation and interpretation of the historical fragment in light of contemporary concerns to generate an instructive dialogue between past and present, and its future potential.</p><p>These projects evince, too, the agency of the architect in challenging the brief and employing initiative. It\u2019s staggering that the original reservoir brief had assumed a \u201ccap and grass\u201d outcome for those extraordinary subterranean chambers. We wonder how much poorer the community and its urban context would have been with that result.</p><p>Similarly, it\u2019s difficult to imagine the brief for the Tree of Knowledge ever contemplating as compelling an outcome as that delivered by Brian Hooper and m3architecture in Barcaldine. This powerful and enigmatic monument represents a significant architectural achievement in its own right and yet its contributions to the civic life of the local community and to the annals of our national history seem the greater achievements. Both in its skilful and resonant interpretation of a unique historical remnant and in its contribution of a high-quality civic space to a small country town, the Barcaldine project demonstrates the potent impact of the architects\u2019 commitment and tenacity, when harnessed with the support of the local community.</p><p><strong>Hybrids</strong></p><p>The Robin Boyd Residential Award winner \u2013 Trial Bay House by HBV Architects \u2013 is without question a fine piece of architecture, but its preoccupation with formal concerns perhaps limits an understanding of a more progressive position for architecture, evident elsewhere. In their hybridized states, Lyons\u2019 Lyon Housemuseum and Donovan Hill\u2019s Z House ask more difficult questions about the nature of domesticity. Conceptually rich, programmatically challenging and formally bold, the Housemuseum offers an intriguing tension between living and exhibition spaces. The domestic seems peripheral at times, displaced to the project\u2019s edges by the insertion of the \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d cubes of contemporary art display. Tension in the relationship derives from a shifting emphasis between the domestic and the institutional, and the result is an unstable reading of the house.</p><p>A similar sense of instability is found in the architecture of the Z House, which continues the practice\u2019s exploration of the gradients between public and private space in the domestic realm. On a steep slope in Brisbane, the project tests the courtyard house, the terrain and the prospect as ways of engaging architecture and landscape. This test is conducted through the device of the central courtyard and the layered section, the facade and the architectural devices of furniture and aperture. These aren\u2019t the only projects to show interest in hybridized, unstable states. Justin Mallia\u2019s commended multi-residential Yan Lane shows how a thoroughfare is transformed into a studio/house, and how easily a garage becomes an office.</p><p><strong>Architectural intelligence</strong></p><p>It is not a unique observation that the pursuit of purely formal concerns (the rather empty obsession with object making) represents a somewhat indulgent and unsustainable mode of contemporary practice. Heroic formalism is increasingly unviable as a preoccupation for the architect, in view of the scale and intensity of the issues currently confronting us: climate change, energy use, housing affordability, ageing infrastructure, social equity and myriad other challenges.</p><p>This is not to say that the profession must collectively don their hairshirts or that there\u2019s no room for wit and whimsy, beauty and delight. There is much of this to be had in the awards and it is welcomed. We are reminded of Shane Murray\u2019s remarks, however, that architects should be concerned with the worth of their contribution, not their market share. Architectural intelligence deployed in confronting these challenges is a contribution worth awarding.</p><blockquote><p><em>Philip Goldswain</em>&#160;is associate dean in the Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Visual Arts at the University of Western Australia.&#160;<em>Melinda Payne</em>is associate to the Government Architect of Western Australia.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>It\u2019s a numbers game: Eli Giannini</strong></h3><p>Informed, or should I say warned, by the recent Australian elections and assisted by one of my colleagues, I present here a little number crunching on the state and national awards results. Every year architects offer their most prized and hard-won creations for scrutiny by their peers. The winning projects, all products of our contemporary culture, have travelled along roads as unique as the professional path pursued by each jury member. Or have they? My motivation for delving into this year\u2019s national awards is simply that I would like to see the rich diversity of contemporary discourse reflected in the variety of projects chosen by the juries. Our own cultural health depends on the architectural diversity we are able to encompass.</p><p>The next generation, we are told, is dispensing with the voice of the expert, preferring instead to take its chance in straw polls conducted via Twitter and blogs. So it may be that in the future we will enjoy extreme diversity. Or perhaps quite the contrary, as world domination by the most media-savvy leads to a narrowing of horizons, where the winners will be of the one-size-fits-all variety.</p><p>Conscious of the fact that even the architectural profession may end up with a hung parliament by giving everyone a vote \u2013 don\u2019t laugh, the more-same, more-same problem is present in all architectural and industry media \u2013 I want to shed light on a few basic facts of the awards process.</p><p>This year, the largest number of state award entries is from Queensland, followed by New South Wales and Victoria, then Western Australia and South Australia, and finally the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and the Northern Territory (Fig 1). It seems, from the numbers, that Queensland has a very healthy system in place, which allows regional areas to participate in the competition. This is surely a good thing for the promotion of architecture. Queensland also takes a good swag of prizes in the national competition, proving that quantity isn\u2019t necessarily the enemy of quality.</p><p>Looking at all categories common to state and national levels, the proportion of premiated entries in each differs greatly from state to state. Generally speaking, the larger the category, the smaller the portion of projects in the prize pool. For example, projects entered in New South Wales and Victoria have the least chance of being awarded at state level because the overall number of projects in these states is larger. Setting this aside, however, there is a significant divergence in the proportion each state decides to award within each category area.</p><p>New South Wales, for example, only gives awards to 6.3 percent of its total single residential entries, while in other states 13\u201350 percent of the projects entered are premiated. In fact, the single residential category is perhaps the hardest done by when we see how judging plays out in the competition. This year only three prizes were awarded in the national residential category, from an original pool of 205 state entries and twenty-five national entries. In my opinion this number is too small to display the diversity of design practice and the quality of output in this country.</p><p>One reason for the large number of entries in this category is that residential new and residential renovations and additions are both entered. The majority of the profession practises almost exclusively in this area, which also adds to the category\u2019s popularity.</p><p>I can only speculate as to why the prize pool is so small. Perhaps juries are not well equipped for doing the numbers when confronted with riches of choice. They may also feel that erring on the side of generosity will brand them as indiscriminate, so they award the expected maximum of four or five prizes, no matter the circumstances.</p><p>I suggest that a more critical overview is needed to counter this practice in future state and national programs. The last national reform of the awards program led sensibly to the introduction of a new prize for small projects, a separate category for multiple residential projects and better integration of state and national awards and prizes. Perhaps this reform should continue. Splitting residential new from renovation and additions would increase the prize pool and give greater variety of judging in the residential categories.</p><p>Public architecture is also poorly premiated in New South Wales, while Victoria and Queensland were particularly reticent to grant interior architecture prizes. Urban design proved a popular category with juries in New South Wales and Queensland, while Victoria awarded only 18 percent of its entries in this category, less than half the number of winners New South Wales delivered at state level.</p><p>Heritage was well represented throughout, with 30 percent receiving an award. Projects in the sustainability category were least premiated in Queensland and Victoria (around 25 percent) by a factor of two in comparison with other states, which does not reflect the need for sustainability in either place.</p><p>My favourite statistic, and perhaps the one I would pick as the litmus test for the health and wellbeing of the whole system, is the one showing first-time winners. How many projects by architects not previously awarded reach the national competition?&#160;</p><p>This year there were seventeen, of these five in residential and small respectively. What is interesting from a national perspective is that more than 60 percent of these come from Victoria. Is this a reflection of the judging process in this state or its greater number of new practices or both? Looking across the board, a particular disappointment for me was witnessing the great depth and quality of the Victorian multiple residential category getting lost in the judging process at both state and national levels, despite a good effort by the state jury to award a larger number of entries.</p><p>The interior, public and commercial categories also lost depth in the final outcome despite the excellence of the winning projects. This is clearly illustrated in Fig 2 when we consider the number of winning projects at national level as a proportion of number of entries for the different categories.</p><p>Post-mortems done somewhat remotely from the subject may not be 100 percent accurate but I hope this delivers a heartfelt plea for a more expansive outlook by the juries. Short-listing too narrowly or basing decisions purely on the success of the photograph isn\u2019t enough to deliver the diversity we need. Visiting more projects in the future is essential and the only true way of determining if a project is worthy of consideration for an award.</p><p>The Australian Institute of Architects awards program is a way of highlighting the creativity and excellence that exists in Australia. The work must be judged by those who can understand and appreciate this diversity.</p><blockquote><p><em>Eli Giannini</em> is a director of MGS Architects in Melbourne.</p></blockquote>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Rob Malkin of Autodesk Australia New Zealand looks at how visualization software can help practices coordinate documentation, communicate design proposals and offer better design insight.</strong></p><p>Predicting how occupants, visitors or neighbours will react to and interact with a building is a crucial part of the design process.&#160;Will this building cast shadows on the neighbouring park? Will this&#160;brick facade fit in with the other buildings around it? Will this lobby&#160;area get too congested? Will this light monitor provide enough daylight to the hallway below it? These types of questions are best answered by \u201cseeing the design\u201d and experiencing the design before it is real.</p><p>A computable building information modelling (BIM) platform such as the Autodesk<sup>\u00ae</sup> Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> platform brings with it the ability to predict the performance of a building before it is built. One aspect of a building\u2019s performance is how people will experience the space, and accurate design visualization is fundamental to predicting the effect the building will have.</p><p>By using visualization tools such as Autodesk<sup>\u00ae</sup> <sub>3</sub>ds Max<sup>\u00ae</sup> Design, architects and designers can see how the design will work and uncover areas where problems exist during the design phase. The earlier in the design process this type of review is done, the easier it is to resolve issues. Ultimately, design visualization can help architects create better designs and sharpen their competitive edge.</p><p><strong>Visualizing an architectural design</strong></p><p>Visualizing an architectural design often relies on envisioning the building based on orthogonal drawings, a small-scale physical model, an artist\u2019s sketch or watercolour. Visualizations such as these can be hampered by the viewer\u2019s ability to mentally interpret 2D drawings, the static nature of the medium and, in the case of models or artists\u2019 renderings, the cost to produce them.</p><p>The advent of CAD and <sub>3</sub>D modelling technology ushered in computer-based visualization, which complements the traditional visualizations described above. Shaded <sub>3</sub>D views, photo-like renderings, animated walk-throughs \u2013 these types of design visualizations are much more effective for communicating a <sub>3</sub>D design and are now widely used to explore, validate and convey architectural design concepts.</p><p>Most architectural authoring tools, including Revit-based applications, have some sort of built-in or in-line visualization capabilities for quick feedback during the design process. Purpose-built visualization tools such as Autodesk<sup>\u00ae </sup><sub>3</sub>ds Max<sup>\u00ae</sup> software are then used to deliver the extra realism and special animation effects that characterize today\u2019s visualizations: renderings worthy of an art gallery, animated walk-throughs and fly-bys that resemble movie trailers. For commercial projects and high-end residential projects, these are the norm instead of the exception, expanding the visual context of a design concept for more effective validation and communication.</p><p>If a designer is already using a BIM solution to design the building, the obvious and more efficient visualization workflow is the reuse of that data, avoiding the waste of time and cost to re-create the building model in the visualization application. In addition, the redundant models would have to be synchronized, increasing the time, cost and potential for error.</p><p>Similar building applications, such as structural analysis or energy analysis, are susceptible to the same malady. However, some have avoided the use of redundant models by using the building information model for related building analysis. Similarly, state-of-the-art design visualization tools are not taking advantage of building information models for visual analysis.</p><p><strong>Visualizing a building information model</strong></p><p>BIM produces highly accurate and detailed building models. So it is natural to expect that those models can also be used for advanced visualizations, such as a rendering, or an urban building project with the existing structures surrounding it, or a lighting study that shows precisely how a new lightshelf design will affect indoor lighting at all times of the day and throughout the seasons.</p><p><strong>Explore design concepts</strong></p><p>The freedom to experiment during the conceptual stage enables designers to more quickly explore design alternatives and gain a better understanding of the impact of their ideas earlier on. Design visualization tools, such as <sub>3</sub>ds Max<sup>\u00ae</sup> Design, offer a powerful modelling tool set that complements the BIM workflow during conceptualization. The software enables designers to more freely create and manipulate complex organic shapes and drive geometry procedurally in an iterative manner via built-in, rules-based modifications and constraints.</p><p><strong>Validate and communicate design concepts</strong></p><p>Design visualization allows designers to better visualize a project in context, which is crucial to making informed design decisions. Various tools and features, such as Exposure\u2122 technology in <sub>3</sub>ds Max<sup>\u00ae</sup> Design, help simulate and analyse sun, sky and artificial lighting. These capabilities allow designers to tell the story of their design, throughout the design process, to both colleagues and clients. Using design visualization, designers can then better communicate information quickly, compellingly and persuasively.</p><p><strong>Using BIM for greener designs</strong></p><p>BIM contributes to sustainable designs by enabling more accurate and efficient designs to streamline the construction process and significantly reduce the chance of human error. This leads to fewer physical materials being used during the construction stage, which cuts costs and wasted resources. Tools within BIM-based products also allow designers to measure and analyse the effects of daylighting and conduct energy analysis to maximize the sustainability of a building.</p><p>Products that incorporate design visualization and BIM are increasing the efficiency of the design process for architects by enabling more accurate and easy-to-understand <sub>3</sub>D models. These models are allowing architects to communicate concepts and ideas to clients more clearly and quickly, which helps with winning business and increasing business productivity.</p><p><strong>BIM and design visualization in action</strong></p><p>Architectus has been using <sub>3</sub>D design software purpose-built for building information modelling (BIM) to consistently deliver intelligent architectural solutions, notable for their simplicity and performance. The company is realizing immediate competitive advantage by optimizing the design and documentation process and capitalizing on intelligent <sub>3</sub>D design. The firm exceeds client expectations by delivering more complete documents and higher quality designs. Staff and project productivity is maximized through better coordination and integration of project documents.</p><p>With a strong reputation for project delivery, Architectus sought to streamline the design and documentation process in a bid to further enhance its services. The company adopted Revit<sup>\u00ae </sup>Architecture software as the key platform underpinning its building information modelling approach to project delivery. Today, Architectus relies on Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture software to communicate design proposals more quickly and clearly, to offer better design insight through on-demand visualization and analysis, and to provide a process that mirrors the real world of building.</p><p><strong>Greater productivity</strong></p><p>Since adopting Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture software, Architectus has transformed the way it creates, amends and delivers designs. The company now has the ability to design throughout different phases and to quickly and easily make changes to major compositional elements. It can create comprehensive design proposals and realize its clients\u2019 ideas on the fly with <sub>3</sub>D views. It can also make late-stage changes without having to manually coordinate model views, drawing sheets, schedules, sections, plans and other design information. More importantly, Revit<sup>\u00ae </sup>Architecture helps Architectus to provide designs and documentation that are coordinated, consistent and complete.</p><p>Architectus has dramatically reduced the time spent on iterating designs, particularly where detail is consistently added to various elements and phases of the design process. According to Rodd Perey, design technology director of the Sydney Architectus office, \u201cOriginally we saw Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture as a design and presentation tool but, in my view, the strength of the product is its ability to manage and coordinate all the elements needed for successful building design and construction documentation. We use Revit Architecture to produce our door, window and finishes schedules and many other types of analysis. The documents remain fully coordinated, allowing outstanding design issues to become immediately obvious.\u201d</p><p><strong>Enhanced coordination, quality and communication</strong></p><p>Using BIM technology, the company can keep computable information about a building project in design and construction up to date and accessible in an integrated digital environment. This gives architects, engineers, builders and owners a clear overall vision of their projects and enables faster decision making, helping raise the quality of projects.</p><p>From conceptual studies through to the most detailed construction drawings and schedules, Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture software helps Architectus coordinate its projects effortlessly. With the Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture parametric change engine, the company can make amendments to any part of the design and have the changes automatically integrated and coordinated throughout the project. It also enables the company to enhance client communications and accelerate decision making by gaining timely feedback on project design, scope, schedule and budget, while minimizing costly efforts to coordinate documents manually.</p><p><strong>Realizing a return on investment</strong></p><p>Architectus has made a strategic investment in design visualization tools, not just in terms of software, but also in relation to staff training, quality assurance systems and procedures as well as extensive in-house customizations. The adoption of Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture is further maximizing the value of the company\u2019s investment, as the solution builds on its existing systems with BIM capabilities being developed alongside existing applications.</p><p>Perey explains, \u201cArchitecture is a competitive environment, and the purpose of any technology is to allow us to make the best use of the skills and experience of our professional staff. Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture eliminates many tedious tasks, and our staff are very enthusiastic about using it.\u201d</p><p>Perey goes on to add, \u201cWith each project we take Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture technology one step further. We are now using Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture as the basis for analysing a building\u2019s environmentally sustainable design (ESD) performance, code compliance, construction sequencing and logistics. We are sharing models with multi-disciplinary teams for structural analysis and MEP integration, and using the built-in coordination and interference checking tool to reduce errors.\u201d</p><p><strong>The result</strong></p><p>Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture software is delivering significant benefits to Architectus, providing the company with a key point of differentiation and further boosting its position as a leader in the architecture and design field. Architectus now relies on Revit<sup>\u00ae</sup> Architecture to keep its designs and documentation coordinated, consistent and complete, to communicate design proposals more quickly and clearly, and to offer better design insight through on-demand visualization and analysis. Overall, the company is delivering on its commitment to project success and excellent service through enhanced communication and collaboration, integrated processes and streamlined systems.</p><blockquote><p><em>Rob Malkin</em> is sales director architecture, engineering and construction, at Autodesk Australia New Zealand.</p></blockquote>",

Alongside the two-dimensional depictions, a beautiful scale model based on the research illustrations and photographs will also be exhibited.</p><p>Associate Professor Charles Rice received a UTS early career research grant to study Portman\u2019s architecture in 2009, and was assisted in his research by recent Master of Architecture graduate Alina McConnochie.</p><p>Said Rice: \u201cWhat really interests me about Portman\u2019s architecture is the way the interior space develops a kind of urbanism via its circular structure, creating cities within cites without reference to the outside.\u201d</p><p>The Portman spaces are also of contemporary significance, Rice explains: \u201cIn parts of the Middle East, contemporary urban development has amplified this concept on a massive scale, creating enormous closed urban environments. These spaces enable both insulation against the harsh climate and heightened levels of security and control.\u201d</p><p>Rice\u2019s extensive research of Portman architecture has also recently provided crucial information for the US Pavilion exhibition at this year\u2019s Venice Architecture Biennale. A comprehensive three-dimensional digital model of the centre, developed by Alina McConnochie, was used as the basis for Portman and Associates\u2019 own digital modelling of the centre. This enabled them to produce rapid prototype physical models of the Peachtree Centre for the US Pavilion exhibit.</p>",

It examines the relationship between the skyscraper and the natural world, the skyscraper and the community, and the skyscraper and the city.</p><p>The exponential increase of the world\u2019s population and its unprecedented shift from rural to urban areas has prompted hundreds of new developments without adequate urban planning and poor architectural design. The aim of this competition is to redefine what we understand as a skyscraper and initiate a new architectural discourse of economic, environmental, intellectual, and perceptual responsibility that could ultimately modify our cities and improve our way of life.</p><p>The use of new materials, technologies, aesthetics, and novel spatial organizations, along with studies on globalisation, flexibility, adaptability and the digital revolution are some of the multi-layered elements that the participants should take into consideration. This is also an investigation on the public and private space and the role of the individual and the collective in the creation of a dynamic and adaptive vertical community.</p><p>There are no restrictions in regards to site, program or size. The objective is to provide maximum freedom to the participants to engage the project without constraints in the most creative way. What is a skyscraper in the 21st century? What are the historical, contextual, social, urban, and environmental responsibilities of these mega-structures?</p><p>Students, architects, engineers, and designers are invited to participate in the competition.
