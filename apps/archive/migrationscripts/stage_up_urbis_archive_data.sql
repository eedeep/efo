For some, the word Parsifal is associated with Wagner’s opera. For others, it’s the German version of Percival – the knight of medieval legend who searched for the Holy Grail. For Danish businessman Kim Vibe Petersen and his wife Nina, however, it’s first and foremost the name of their three most recent yachts. The original Parsifal had already been christened when they bought it, and “we continued with Parsifal as it sounds sweet to our friends’ ears, because they’ve had a lot of good holidays on the different boats,” he explains.\r\nVibe Petersen is the founder of Scanomat, a company that produces\r\ncoffee machines. Run initially out of a 25sqm garage, it has\r\ncome a long way from its humble beginnings. In 1985, the company\r\nlaunched the world’s first automatic cappuccino machine and has\r\nnow sold more than 150,000 coffee brewers in over 46 countries.\r\nHis boats have also grown in size. He started sailing at the age of\r\nnine on a tiny Optimist. At 34m the first two Parsifals were relatively\r\nsmall too – at least in comparison to Parsifal III. The latter vessel,\r\na ketch, is a stately 54m in length and boasts a lofty 59.4m main\r\nmast. With its lightweight aluminium hull, it can reach a maximum\r\nspeed of 15 knots. Like most of the world’s large, luxury yachts, it\r\nwas built at the Perini Navi shipyard in Viareggio, Italy. “I always\r\nhad a dream to build a Perini Navi,” admits Vibe Petersen. “I like\r\nthe style, the look and the detailing of their boats. It’s a brand that\r\nexudes quality.”\r\nThe pedigree of the boat’s designer, Ron Holland, isn’t bad either.\r\nBorn in New Zealand, he created a number of yachts that were successful\r\nin the Admiral’s Cup in the ‘70s and co-designed the world’s\r\nfirst fiberglass, 12m sailing boat for Team New Zealand’s 1986-7\r\nAmerica’s Cup challenge. Mostly, however, he has become known\r\nfor his large yachts, such as the world’s biggest single-mast sailing\r\nvessel, Mirabella V. At 74.5m in length, it accommodates both a 20-\r\nperson Jacuzzi and a 600-bottle wine cellar.\r\nParsifal III may not be able to rival that for size, but it certainly\r\noutshines it in terms of interior elegance. The decoration of the boat\r\nis the work of Paris-based Rémi Tessier. When asked why he chose\r\nhim, Vibe Petersen jokingly replies: “Because he’s a clown.” On a\r\nmore serious note, he was impressed with the first yacht on which\r\nTessier worked – The Squall. “I liked the simplicity of the design\r\nand the minimalist kind of luxury,” says Vibe Petersen. “His design\r\nis very different to what has been seen on yachts previously. I think\r\nhe’s really created a new trend.” Indeed, they more closely resemble\r\nstylish penthouses than traditional boats.\r\nBorn in 1964, Tessier originally trained as a carpenter before\r\nfounding his own decorating agency, Dernier Etage, at the age of 23.\r\nHis first project was not the most auspicious – a showcase hall for\r\na real estate development in Antibes. Since then he has gone onto\r\nrather better things: boutiques for Christian Dior and Hugo Boss,\r\nsome 15 villas near Saint-Tropez and numerous apartments in Paris,\r\nincluding one which measures a stately 800sqm.\r\nOn the boats he has worked on, space has been rather more limited.\r\n“A yacht is like a compressed building,” he explains. “A cabin\r\nis a small, gloomy space – a sort of cupboard you have to transform\r\ninto something intimate. Everything has to be transcended on a\r\nboat.” On Parsifal III, he countered the low room heights by using\r\nlight sycamore for the ceilings and by placing a cove for lighting\r\nunder the windows. “It’s important to descend the horizontal line,”\r\ninsists Tessier. “That way, the ceiling appears to be higher than it actually\r\nis.” To optimise space, he fitted cupboards with leather blinds\r\nrather than doors and also tucked handrails into recesses so they\r\ndon’t protrude into corridors. The greatest sense of space, however,\r\nis created by the main deck, with its open plan sitting, dining and\r\nbar areas. “You have a 360 degree view from more or less anywhere\r\nin the salon,” says Vibe Petersen. “You can sit on the aft deck and\r\nlook through the front window 30m away.”\r\nAesthetically, Tessier’s interiors are largely based upon sobriety\r\nand tactile materials. In Parsifal III, sensuousness is a key feature\r\nin the cabins, whether in the form of the leather-topped bedside\r\ntables or the plaited mink bedcovers. His greatest design influences\r\ngenerally come from Scandinavia; influences include Hans J\r\nWegner, Poul Kjaerholm and Finn Juhl. Here, however, the starting\r\npoint for the furniture came from a French designer – the Lyonbased\r\nArt Deco master, André Sornay, whose work Vibe Petersen\r\nhad spotted in a gallery in Nice. He was particularly struck by a set\r\nof ebony dining chairs.\r\nTessier decided to use the same wood throughout and created a\r\nstriking contrast to it with white calf leather and woollen rugs. “It\r\nreally makes the interior dynamic and fresh, rather than gloomy,\r\nwhich could have been the case with a lot of dark wood,” he says.\r\nThe only burst of colour comes from the Jean-Baptiste Huynh photos\r\nin each of the four guest cabins (two doubles and two twins) on\r\nthe lower deck.\r\nAnother of the Vibe Petersens’ requests was for lots of curves.\r\n“We wanted forms redolent of the swell of the ocean.” The idea for\r\ncreating the indoor bar in the form of a wave came from Nina. It was\r\nTessier, meanwhile, who came up with the adjustable circular sofa. It\r\nconsists of four different elements fitted onto a system of rails which\r\nallows them to be rotated and arranged in different combinations.\r\nFlexibility has also cleverly been built into the master suite, which\r\ncan be split in two for charters with the aid of four panels stored\r\naway in the dressing rooms. They are fixed into place by a system of\r\nlugs that fit into holes in both the ceiling and floor. A sofa then doubles\r\nas a temporary bed in one of the newly created rooms.\r\nVibe Petersen was involved, then, in every turn of the design process.\r\n“He was a real stickler,” recalls the designer. “Incredibly demanding.”\r\nTake the wheelhouse, for instance – a space often given\r\nshort shrift on even the most luxurious sailing boats. Here, it received\r\nthe same chic treatment as the rest of the yacht. Vibe Petersen insisted\r\nthat none of the control panels be visible, so Tessier hid them behind\r\na panel of black glass.\r\nFortunately, that kind of attention to detail does not stop him,\r\nNina and their three children from having fun. “They are very convivial\r\nand love entertaining their friends,” asserts Tessier. When\r\non board Parsifal III, the list of possible activities is almost endless\r\n– swimming, dinghy sailing, jet-skiing, surfing, going on shore\r\nto laze on beaches or visit mountain villages. “You can also have a\r\nnice meal at our five-star restaurant on board,” adds Vibe Petersen.\r\nTheir Australian chef, Jay, is apparently a whiz in the galley.\r\nThat said, they haven’t had much time to take advantage of\r\nParsifal III since it took to the waters last year. “It was rented for\r\nmost of the summer and we only spent one week on it off the coast\r\nof Corfu and Croatia,” says Vibe Petersen. At Christmas, the boat\r\nwas chartered for a fortnight by “one of the world’s richest men”.\r\nYou certainly need to be wealthy to afford it. The average hire price\r\nis a cool �250,000 per week.','	<p><img src=\"/images/14.jpg\" class=\"imgright\" alt=\"\" /> For some, the word Parsifal is associated with Wagner’s opera.

Run initially out of a 25sqm garage, it has<br />\ncome a long way from its humble beginnings. In 1985, the company<br />\nlaunched the world’s first automatic cappuccino machine and has<br />\nnow sold more than 150,000 coffee brewers in over 46 countries.<br />\nHis boats have also grown in size. He started sailing at the age of<br />\nnine on a tiny Optimist. At 34m the first two Parsifals were relatively<br />\nsmall too – at least in comparison to Parsifal III. The latter vessel,<br />\na ketch, is a stately 54m in length and boasts a lofty 59.4m main<br />\nmast. With its lightweight aluminium hull, it can reach a maximum<br />\nspeed of 15 knots. Like most of the world’s large, luxury yachts, it<br />\nwas built at the Perini Navi shipyard in Viareggio, Italy. “I always<br />\nhad a dream to build a Perini Navi,” admits Vibe Petersen. “I like<br />\nthe style, the look and the detailing of their boats. It’s a brand that<br />\nexudes quality.”<br />\nThe pedigree of the boat’s designer, Ron Holland, isn’t bad either.<br />\nBorn in New Zealand, he created a number of yachts that were successful<br />\nin the Admiral’s Cup in the ‘70s and co-designed the world’s<br />\nfirst fiberglass, 12m sailing boat for Team New Zealand’s 1986-7<br />\nAmerica’s Cup challenge. Mostly, however, he has become known<br />\nfor his large yachts, such as the world’s biggest single-mast sailing<br />\nvessel, Mirabella V. At 74.5m in length, it accommodates both a 20-<br />\nperson Jacuzzi and a 600-bottle wine cellar.<br />\nParsifal III may not be able to rival that for size, but it certainly<br />\noutshines it in terms of interior elegance. The decoration of the boat<br />\nis the work of Paris-based Rémi Tessier. When asked why he chose<br />\nhim, Vibe Petersen jokingly replies: “Because he’s a clown.” On a<br />\nmore serious note, he was impressed with the first yacht on which<br />\nTessier worked – The Squall. “I liked the simplicity of the design<br />\nand the minimalist kind of luxury,” says Vibe Petersen. “His design<br />\nis very different to what has been seen on yachts previously. I think<br />\nhe’s really created a new trend.” Indeed, they more closely resemble<br />\nstylish penthouses than traditional boats.<br />\nBorn in 1964, Tessier originally trained as a carpenter before<br />\nfounding his own decorating agency, Dernier Etage, at the age of 23.<br />\nHis first project was not the most auspicious – a showcase hall for<br />\na real estate development in Antibes. Since then he has gone onto<br />\nrather better things: boutiques for Christian Dior and Hugo Boss,<br />\nsome 15 villas near Saint-Tropez and numerous apartments in Paris,<br />\nincluding one which measures a stately 800sqm.<br />\nOn the boats he has worked on, space has been rather more limited.<br />\n“A yacht is like a compressed building,” he explains. “A cabin<br />\nis a small, gloomy space – a sort of cupboard you have to transform<br />\ninto something intimate. Everything has to be transcended on a<br />\nboat.” On Parsifal III, he countered the low room heights by using<br />\nlight sycamore for the ceilings and by placing a cove for lighting<br />\nunder the windows. “It’s important to descend the horizontal line,”<br />\ninsists Tessier. “That way, the ceiling appears to be higher than it actually<br />\nis.” To optimise space, he fitted cupboards with leather blinds<br />\nrather than doors and also tucked handrails into recesses so they<br />\ndon’t protrude into corridors. The greatest sense of space, however,<br />\nis created by the main deck, with its open plan sitting, dining and<br />\nbar areas. “You have a 360 degree view from more or less anywhere<br />\nin the salon,” says Vibe Petersen. “You can sit on the aft deck and<br />\nlook through the front window 30m away.”<br />\nAesthetically, Tessier’s interiors are largely based upon sobriety<br />\nand tactile materials. In Parsifal III, sensuousness is a key feature<br />\nin the cabins, whether in the form of the leather-topped bedside<br />\ntables or the plaited mink bedcovers. His greatest design influences<br />\ngenerally come from Scandinavia; influences include Hans J<br />\nWegner, Poul Kjaerholm and Finn Juhl. Here, however, the starting<br />\npoint for the furniture came from a French designer – the Lyonbased<br />\nArt Deco master, André Sornay, whose work Vibe Petersen<br />\nhad spotted in a gallery in Nice. He was particularly struck by a set<br />\nof ebony dining chairs.<br />\nTessier decided to use the same wood throughout and created a<br />\nstriking contrast to it with white calf leather and woollen rugs. “It<br />\nreally makes the interior dynamic and fresh, rather than gloomy,<br />\nwhich could have been the case with a lot of dark wood,” he says.<br />\nThe only burst of colour comes from the Jean-Baptiste Huynh photos<br />\nin each of the four guest cabins (two doubles and two twins) on<br />\nthe lower deck.<br />\nAnother of the Vibe Petersens’ requests was for lots of curves.<br />\n“We wanted forms redolent of the swell of the ocean.” The idea for<br />\ncreating the indoor bar in the form of a wave came from Nina. It was<br />\nTessier, meanwhile, who came up with the adjustable circular sofa. It<br />\nconsists of four different elements fitted onto a system of rails which<br />\nallows them to be rotated and arranged in different combinations.<br />\nFlexibility has also cleverly been built into the master suite, which<br />\ncan be split in two for charters with the aid of four panels stored<br />\naway in the dressing rooms. They are fixed into place by a system of<br />\nlugs that fit into holes in both the ceiling and floor. A sofa then doubles<br />\nas a temporary bed in one of the newly created rooms.<br />\nVibe Petersen was involved, then, in every turn of the design process.<br />\n“He was a real stickler,” recalls the designer. “Incredibly demanding.”<br />\nTake the wheelhouse, for instance – a space often given<br />\nshort shrift on even the most luxurious sailing boats. Here, it received<br />\nthe same chic treatment as the rest of the yacht. Vibe Petersen insisted<br />\nthat none of the control panels be visible, so Tessier hid them behind<br />\na panel of black glass.<br />\nFortunately, that kind of attention to detail does not stop him,<br />\nNina and their three children from having fun. “They are very convivial<br />\nand love entertaining their friends,” asserts Tessier. When<br />\non board Parsifal III, the list of possible activities is almost endless<br />\n– swimming, dinghy sailing, jet-skiing, surfing, going on shore<br />\nto laze on beaches or visit mountain villages. “You can also have a<br />\nnice meal at our five-star restaurant on board,” adds Vibe Petersen.<br />\nTheir Australian chef, Jay, is apparently a whiz in the galley.<br />\nThat said, they haven’t had much time to take advantage of<br />\nParsifal III since it took to the waters last year. “It was rented for<br />\nmost of the summer and we only spent one week on it off the coast<br />\nof Corfu and Croatia,” says Vibe Petersen. At Christmas, the boat<br />\nwas chartered for a fortnight by “one of the world’s richest men”.<br />\nYou certainly need to be wealthy to afford it. The average hire price<br />\nis a cool �250,000 per week.</p>\n\n ','','\n\n ','','','',0,'',0,2,1,1,'magazine','','','ocean-suave','','','','','','','','','','','efee3db6ed6c36788905c0375ec82ca2','2006-02-27'),(10,'2006-02-27 20:58:00','Shaun Humphreys','2006-03-22 14:20:17','Shaun Humphreys','Please check your email!','','You will shortly receive a confirmation email with instructions on how to activate your _Urbanism_ subscription.\r\n\r\nIf you do not receive an email, please \"contact site admin\":mailto:admin@urbismagazine.com','	<p>You will shortly receive a confirmation email with instructions on how to activate your <em>Urbanism</em> subscription.</p>\n	<p>If you do not receive an email, please <a href=\"mailto:admin@urbismagazine.com\">contact site admin</a></p>\n\n ','','\n\n ','','','',0,'',0,4,1,1,'misc','','','confirm-your-subscription-to-urbanism','','','','','','','','','','','c64629c697778135a39972fe61c4af77','2006-02-27'),(11,'2006-02-27 21:00:00','Shaun Humphreys','2006-03-22 14:20:02','Shaun Humphreys','Thank you','','You are now subscribed to Urbanism :)','	<p>You are now subscribed to Urbanism :)</p>\n\n ','','\n\n ','','','',0,'',0,4,1,1,'misc','','','thank-you','','','','','','','','','','','9fc989933125d07ddbb8031212ba81e3','2006-02-27'),(12,'2006-02-27 21:05:00','Shaun Humphreys','2009-02-24 09:17:53','nicole.stock','Subscribe to Urbanism','','<p>Subscribe to the latest design news delivered directly to your inbox every month...</p>\r\n<form action=\"http://www.urbismagazine.com/sendstudio/users/form.php?FormID=2\" method=\"post\" name=\"frmSS\" onSubmit=\"return CheckSS()\">\r\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"SelectLists[1]\" value=\"YES\" />\r\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"Format\" value=\"2\" />\r\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"FormCode\" value=\"5ae572adb8cdeb44d737d94d21a19778\" />	  \r\n	<p>First name<br />\r\n      <input id=\"input1\" name=\"Fields[1]\" type=\"text\" size=\"20\" /></p>\r\n	<p>Last name<br />\r\n      <input id=\"input2\" name=\"Fields[2]\" type=\"text\" size=\"20\" /></p>\r\n    <p>Email<br />\r\n	  <input id=\"input0\" name=\"Email\" type=\"text\" size=\"20\" /></p>\r\n      <br />\r\n	  <input  id=\"btn\" name=\"submit\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" />\r\n</form>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n	// check multi checkboxes based on the name passed in.\r\n	function CheckMultiple(name) \r\n	{\r\n		theFrm = document.frmSS;\r\n		for (var i=0;

First the slog to Thames, the memory of which is quickly flung aside once past the shopping centre. Those pastel-coloured beach communities, too, are left behind as the car continues along the narrow pohutukawa-framed road on the western edge of the Coromandel, each gyrating twist of the road giving an alluring glimpse of sheltered bays. Then the turn off to Whangapoua but even here, so tantalisingly close, anticipation is drawn out as the car meanders along a long causeway over mudflats before finally reaching the house’s driveway. At the end of the drive a copse of trees sway languidly in the breeze. The shimmying branches, obscure the house just behind and invite an eager curiosity by not revealing everything at once. The architecture of seduction.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article>\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"567\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n</txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nBehind those fringed trees, the house is finally exposed. But even here it never feels naked; its simple skin has been layered and folded to both reveal and conceal at the same time. This is a simple house, conceived as “a shelter in between two verandas” by architect Jane Aimer, a partner in Auckland practice Scarlet Architects. It is also quite small, with a single living area in one axis and three modest bedrooms perpendicular. Both in ideology and form, the house is transparent, designed to draw the gaze through the house and out to the beach. A view carefully framed to offer containment as well as openness. \r\n\r\nThere is no front door nor any hallway. Such suburban tropes have been behind left in Auckland. Here the back deck is entry, hallway and alternate living room, requiring occupants to walk outside to get to the toilet or bedrooms. From its size to its planning, this building manages what many other well-crafted beach homes don’t: to be a bach. \r\n\r\nWhich is exactly what the clients wanted. When they bought the beach-side property a small bach perched on the edge of the site just above the high-tide line. They spent their first summer in that old bach and found its simple arrangement perfectly suited to beach side living. The late Dick Mercer, a well-known Waikato architect, designed and built the original bach which was a simple gabled room with deep covered decks to the front and back. The initial brief, then, to Scarlet Architects was to retain the original bach but push it out to allow more space for the clients’ adult family. This was easier imagined than achieved since the little building was resolutely within the beach setback and no additions could be made to it where it stood. The clients resigned themselves to outlining a new brief for a new building, albeit one that retained the same feel as the old bach and, in particular, made use of the double deck arrangement.\r\n\r\nWhile Jane Aimer thought that removing the worn old bach was the best solution, she was still nervous about telling Adam Mercer, her colleague across the hall at her Newmarket office. Mercer, also an architect, is the son of Dick Mercer, and had helped his father build the original bach. Having told Adam of her plan to demolish the bach, Jane was relieved that he was also pleased. Mercer explained that he’d been about ten when he and his father nailed the house together from whatever they could find, and he wasn’t looking forward to anyone opening up the walls a few decades on.\r\n\r\nThe bach isn’t completely gone, however. Rather than knock it down and cart it to the tip, the builder, Rod Percival, the builder, who has a keen interest in sustainability, had his team dismantle the bach and locals came and picked up lots for a small donation to the local preschool. Around Whangapoua, a rogue windowpane, or a sink from the original bach, may be seen grafted onto a new house.\r\n\r\nThe entire concept revolved around the two decks. The seaward elevation’s rectangular frame is created by the covered deck with the high edge of the monopitch roof steeped back above. The front deck is used like a living room, its proportions mimicking the interior living space alongside. The back deck sits in the crook between the living pavilion and the bedrooms, poised to catch the afternoon sun. Without it, this spot would have been a barren no-man’s land in the armpit of the L-shaped plan between living and bedrooms. Its inclusion sets up a stepped rear elevation that is primed for an elegant layering of forms. The shadows and textures created from the considered arrangement of reveals and materials gives a richness that again takes this bach away from the suburban model of favouring the side on show at the expense of the concealed elevation.\r\nThe guest bedroom, furthest from the sea, has an ample corner window that pushes out, giving a wide, almost window-seat look to the inside, and creating depth and shadow on the façade. Diametrically opposite, the clerestory window on the living pavilion is pushed deep into the room, again giving depth and shadow, but here too making sure summer sun doesn’t stream into the house. Under the deck, another recess, almost like an aborted hallway, creates shelter for the door to the bathrooms and the doors leading to the bunk room and guest room. Over this full height, sliding shutters add yet another layer while also providing additional shelter on a windy day.\r\nAn outdoor shower sits totem-like at the front of the back deck, proclaiming the casual, shoes-off attitude here. It is like a polished version of the faucet next to the bach door for washing sandy feet. In some ways it seems incongruous, stuck out in the middle here, but it is also practical: you wash your feet off and hop onto the timber boards of the deck, no prancing over stone paths or patches of grass to get to a door. \r\n\r\nThe house also proudly shows off its functionality in less obvious ways as it lifts its skirt to reveal its unusual foundations. As a requirement of building so close to the water, the architects had to demonstrate that the bach could be removable. Aimer decided to make a feature of its lightness on the site and floated the house on piles nearly five metres apart. Huge clear spans under the house allow for storage of kayaks and the other paraphernalia a bach seems to accumulate. It also allows for an elegant continuation of the veranda posts seamlessly from ceiling to ground without extra vertical elements under the deck marring the clean lines.\r\n\r\nClean lines are found throughout this property. The underside of the decks are striped with the protruding white ceiling beams lined either side with unstained Lawson’s cypress. Making a seamless transition between inside and out, the timber is carried through into the ceilings. The knotty, golden, tongue and groove ceiling alludes to another Kiwi bach icon, the old Lockwood. Here, however, with white walls and a more neutral Pilularis floor, the timber ceiling doesn’t feel too heavy or woody but still has the effect of making the double-height space feel lived in and cosy.\r\nThis bach is seductive in its simplicity. A careful interpretation of the bach, this is a home that is both thoughtful in its architecture and in the way it will be used. u\r\n\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\nWords nicole stock <br />\n/ photographs whit preston<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Scarlet Architects have crafted a simple bach in the coromandel  reminiscent of baches of old.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>Getting here is a slow tease.

Alongside 600 new game cards, the <i>Cranium</i> movers have been given an overhaul and now come in twelve different characters that players can dress and accessorise. The game’s new look is inspired by ’70s vinyl culture and has recently won awards for its graphic design. <i>Cranium</i> is not a game for the faint hearted, and we here at Urbis have seen many a friendship destroyed over the ultra-competitive game, so caveat emptor!

Alongside a five course degustation dinner and wine match created by Clooney’s award winning chef, Des Harris, fifteen art pieces will be auctioned off with all proceeds going to Cure Kids. Featuring works from Katie Brown, Jill Sorensen, Virginia King and Zambesi, the food will be amazing and the art works aesthetically pleasing, so get in quick because tickets are selling out fast. 29 July at Clooney, Sale St, Auckland.

Romeo and Juliet Onstage\r\n\r\n!(imgleft)/images/485.jpg! With their families locked in a bitter feud, Romeo and Juliet’s fate is doomed. While they will do anything to be together their families will do anything to keep them apart. The world’s most tragic tale of fleeting love and untimely death is back on the ballet stage with Royal New Zealand Ballet’s production of Romeo and Juliet. Nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award following its UK tour in 2004, this is a beautiful but heart wrenching production. On now until 24 August throughout New Zealand.\r\n>>Visit \"www.nzballet.org.nz\":http://www.nzballet.org.nz\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nh4. Mahler\'s 5th\r\n\r\n!(imgright)/images/488.jpg! Mahler said “a symphony should create a world”, and his Fifth Symphony, inspired by passionate romance and a near death experience takes listeners on an epic journey from despair to joy. The symphony is conducted by the young Ukrainian Kirill Karabits, who returns to Auckland after his lauded Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra debut in 2007. Prefacing the symphony is Bartók’s first piano concerto, played by Susanna Stefani-Caetani, whose electrifying performance of this work unleashes its pounding energy and eerie magnetism.

There’s something of the Doctor’s spacecraft about this Freeman’s Bay house, and it’s not just the futuristic façade.\r\n\r\n!(imgright)/images/43.jpg (Space age)!  From the outside, it’s hard to imagine how the narrow, awkwardly angled site, sandwiched between two typical Ponsonby villas and bookended by a road at each end, could contain a pool, a garden, a courtyard, three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two living areas and a full bar. But thanks to clever use of mirrors and windows, hidden- away storage that would do the Tardis proud, and a design that takes advantage of the slope of the site, all this has fitted into just 462 square metres in a surprisingly spacious way.\r\n\r\n“Basically, what I wanted was something where the kids and I could have our own spaces,” says owner Angela Hull. “It had to have a pool, of course, and it had to be easy living – I didn’t want to have to worry about maintenance. And it had to look good.”\r\n\r\nHull had seen the work architect Daniel Marshall had done for friends of hers, and on that basis sat down with him to discuss the site. “We just got on really well,” she shrugs. “It wasn’t an easy job, because it’s a large house on a small site, and it’s an angled site too, which made it even more difficult. But Daniel did an amazing job.”\r\n\r\nTo start with, the original house, which Marshall describes as a “falling-down, brick and tile bungalow-cross-disaster,” had to be removed completely. The new plan aimed to take advantage of the leafy park, city and suburban views from both ends of the site, separate spaces for the adults’ and children’s entertaining, and provide a backdrop for Hull’s beloved art collection.\r\n\r\nAlthough some might feel uncomforable about the siting of the dining room at the very front of the house, up above street level and boldly put on view to passers-by, Marshall says it was exactly what they wanted to do. “Well, some people like being on display!” he laughs. “But it’s not too public. It faces a park, and there are blinds that you can put down. And the house is a series of spaces that move from the public to the private and back to the public again. Dining is often a public experience, so this was our response to the verandah area of the old house, where people used to sit and look out at the neighbourhood. That’s also why we had the transparency in the front fence and gate.”\r\n\r\n[page]\r\n\r\nThe ‘transparency’ he refers to involved alternating black cedar batons to give glimpses into the property, rather than a forbidding solid fence. The batons are repeated again in the cladding on the top level, to bring in the weatherboard feel of the surrounding houses, and in the four-metre tall front door. “We wanted a full height door but all the people who make doors told us we couldn’t have one,” admits Marshall. “So we just had a normal door, and went with concealing all the bits and pieces so it looks like it’s full height, and used a big, long Haliday and Bailey handle.”\r\n\r\n!(imgleft)/images/45.jpg (Space Age)! A pebbled pond surrounds the entrance to the front door, with 1970s-style concrete lilypad stepping-stones leading the way across. “Water is a recurring element – there’s this at the entrance, and then when you move through the living area, it opens up to the pool,” says Marshall. At the top of the entry stairs, there’s a moment of disorientation, as the space opens up to an axis of the kitchen, dining and living areas, with a dozen angles on the space reflected in two extended mirrored walls. “This mirrored area is like a service core in the centre of the dining and living spaces,” Marshall explains. “In the central, mirrored core, there’s the bar, the bathroom and the stairs hidden inside.” One of the walls folds back to reveal a fully-stocked bar and hidden sound system, while the other reflects the view from the wide front window, looking out across a tree-filled reserve. “We decided on the mirrors later on in the piece,” he continues. “People sitting at the table all get a good view – there’s no bum seat at the table!”\r\n\r\nWith simple white walls, black granite countertops, pale Tasmanian oak flooring, white dining chairs at a glass table and black couches, the living area provides a clean, monochromatic space that emphasizes the colourful abstracts of Hull’s art collection. “I do quite like to keep things monochromatic,” Marshall admits. I think architecture is kind of like creating a theatre. We provide a backdrop for the people, for the drama.”  The monochromatic theme continues through to an astonishing living-level bathroom that is completely tiled in black Pirelli rubber tiles, adding another space-age element to the house. “We were going for the idea of a pod,” says Marshall. “It is quite a party bathroom – it’s pretty bling in terms of the rubber and the black glass. !(imgright)/images/44.jpg (Space Age)! But if it’s a room with no windows, you might as well make the most of it, right?” From the living room, it becomes apparent why the site presented a challenge – about two-fifths of the way in, it turns eastward on about a 40-degree angle. “The angle was the really difficult thing about the site,” Marshall says. “But we realized that if we had a courtyard, we could use that to turn it on. In fact, this area is one of the things I’m most pleased with. We’ve kept all of it really simple, although there’s a lot going on down below.”\r\n\r\nThe north-facing pool area, with a granite-tiled courtyard at the far end, looks out towards the city. From the living room, only the treetops and gabled roofs are visible, thanks to the low wall running around the area. “We tried to frame out the close neighbours, while still keeping the views in the middle distance,” says Marshall. Tall neighbouring trees crowd over the courtyard, dropping shiny green olives and casting reflections on the pool.\r\n\r\n[page]\r\n\r\nA glass door leads straight in from the pool area to the stairwell to the lower level of the house. “The stairs are paved, so you can come in from the pool, throw your towels in the laundry and jump into the shower,” Marshall explains. Downstairs, the two children’s rooms and a second living space open up through french doors to a grassed play area. “Everyone wins when you get that separation between the kids’ area and adults’ area,” he continues. “This is all a moderately subterranean area. It must be a bit like living like hobbits!”\r\n\r\nThe upstairs bedroom area caused a few more headaches than the downstairs one. Months of negotiations with Auckland City Council had to be endured before they could come to an agreement on the height and size restrictions for the property. !(imgright)/images/46.jpg (Space Age)! Eventually a compromise was reached that Marshall refers to as the ‘lunar lander’ – a slopesided bedroom and bathroom unit that perches on top of the box of the main house. The zinc roof was designed and made by roofing experts Calder Stewart, and is “beautifully put-together,” says Marshall. “We didn’t have much room up there so we fitted as much into the space as we could. We used the space behind the bedhead as the walkin wardrobe.” The bathroom has a full-size shower and a small, deep Japanese-style bath, tiled in pale blue. \r\n\r\nThis summer has already seen the family enjoying plenty of outdoor living around the pool – and hosting more than a couple of social events. “Yeah – I’m getting a bit of a reputation for building party houses,” Marshall laughs. “But it’s just about thinking about how people are going to use the space and how they’re going to want to live in it and enjoy it.”   \r\n','	<p><strong>A new Freemans Bay home with futuristic styling proves that not only good things, but even big things can sometimes come in small packages.</strong></p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><em>Words Melinda Williams / Photographs Simon Devitt</em> </p>\n\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Remember Dr Who’s Tardis, the jolly blue police-box time machine that was impossibly bigger inside than it was out?

His inspirations are as disparate as furniture designer/architect Eileen Gray, sculptor Brancusi, and the skate parks of California.Humbly comparing his own aesthetic with Brancusi’s he says, “[it’s just] a slab of metal ona hunk of wood. But it’s about the right piece of metal, the right hunk of wood and the perfect gesture.”</p>','Glam-grunge fashion designer to the stars Rick Owens expands his empire to furniture design.','	<p>Glam-grunge fashion designer to the stars Rick Owens expands his empire to furniture design.</p>','/images/35.jpg','mag-dispatch','Issue-31',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','sitting-pretty','','','','','','','','','','','46b5dac6ef062001c47987932beec314','2006-04-01'),(19,'2006-03-19 12:36:00','dean','2006-03-23 20:59:26','Shaun Humphreys','Also in this issue','','*Concrete Brunette*\r\nFashion meets architecture\r\n\r\n*Big Dealers*\r\nWhat’s hot in London retail design\r\n\r\n*Viva Lost Vegas*\r\nWhere old signs are laid to rest\r\n\r\n*Heavy Metal* \r\nKnuckle dusting rings\r\n\r\n*Ocean Suave*\r\nAn Italian superyacht\r\n\r\n*Giants of the Screen*\r\nBig, bad televisions\r\n','	<p><strong>Concrete Brunette</strong><br />\nFashion meets architecture</p>\n	<p><strong>Big Dealers</strong><br />\nWhat’s hot in London retail design</p>\n	<p><strong>Viva Lost Vegas</strong><br />\nWhere old signs are laid to rest</p>\n	<p><strong>Heavy Metal</strong> <br />\nKnuckle dusting rings</p>\n	<p><strong>Ocean Suave</strong><br />\nAn Italian superyacht</p>\n	<p><strong>Giants of the Screen</strong><br />\nBig, bad televisions</p>\n\n\n ','','\n\n ','','','',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','also-in-this-issue','','','','','','','','','','','35863c1c19d07ded398db4c5df308726','2006-03-21'),(35,'2006-03-28 13:42:00','dean','2010-03-26 07:23:16','andre.kini','Urbis contacts','','h4.

Make ours a Malibu.*\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\n_Words by Katie Newton_\r\n\r\n</txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nYou know what it’s like before you’ve even been there. LA: it’s the Hollywood sign, the stars on the Walk of Fame, the surfers at Malibu, and Mickey Mouse at Disneyland. It’s all the ‘hoods from television and songs: Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Long Beach. \r\n\r\n!(imgright)/images/47.jpg (La Story)! It’s the anxious gated communities and the pastel-hued hotels, where people live (live!) in splendid, idle luxury. It’s the guy with the flashy sports car and the girl with the stilettos and the off-the-hook body – with breasts that soar skyward without any help from a bra. It’s absolute plastic perfection, and it’s the absolutely unattainable dream of that. Just ignore the race riots, poverty, car jacking and gridlock. More than any other city in the world, the flotsam and jetsam of life in LA has permeated our collective consciousness.\r\n\r\nAnd we flock there. Not just, of course, for the girls and the weather, but for the industries; entertainment, oil, shipping, finance and aerospace. The 88 independent cities that make up the county popularly known as LA have had ballistic population growth since the beginning of last century, making it the second-largest city in the United States. LAX is the world’s fifth busiest passenger airport, with more than 60 million passengers a year passing through. They too want to discover LA, and experience the intangibles for themselves. The salty tang of the breeze from the Pacific. The exhilaration that hangs in the hot Saturday night air. The silly but thrilling realisation that yes, that is Cameron Diaz getting in her car, heading home from yoga.\r\n\r\nFor what is really the modern cultural epicentre of the Western world, LA is so often perceived to be void of the stuff. While it may lack the history of London or the sophistication of Paris, it has entertainment by the swimming pool. The movie industry has lured in some of the world’s brightest creative talents, the moneyed client base some of the greatest minds of modern architecture and design. Richard Meier’s Getty Centre and Frank Gehry’s Walt Disney Concert Hall are among the many brash and elaborate architectural endeavours that probably would never have been built anywhere else. Rather than seeing LA as a ruined paradise where scented orange groves and acres of coastline have been turned into a tangle of smogchoked freeways and McMansions, see it as a vibrant, decadent city that really just wants to be liked.  \r\n\r\n*WHERE TO STAY* Forget Beverly Hills and Malibu, the most sought-after real estate in LA is the poolside cabanas at *The Viceroy Santa Monica* (\"www.viceroysantamonica.com\":http://www.viceroysantamonica.com). A must-stay for scenesters, the hotel is one block from the beach and the Santa Monica pier, and has extravagant touches such as in-room beauty bars stocked with full-sized products, fl at screen televisions, and Playstation Portables or Playstation 2s – available with or without a one-on-one tutorial from the ‘games butler’.\r\n\r\nOld-time movie buffs might rather stay at the *Hollywood Roosevelt* (\"www.hollywoodroosevelt.com\":http://www.hollywoodroosevelt. com), the original venue for the Academy Awards and gathering place for the stars since 1927. Refurbished last year, it still retains a retro flavour with a cabaret club, upscale burger bar, penthouse with rooftop access to the iconic neon sign, and themed evenings organised by the very lovely socialite, Amanda Sheer Demme. Request the Steven Spielberg room for the best view in the building.\r\n\r\n[page]\r\n\r\nIf you’re after the very latest word in design, *The Chamberlain* (\"www.chamberlainwesthollywood.com\":http://www.chamberlainwesthollywood.com) is the newest member of the Kor Hotel family, oozing understated calm albeit with some quirky touches. Tucked away on a tree-lined residential street in West Hollywood, it has chic interiors in celery and ice blue, fireplaces in every room and a rooftop pool where you can lounge in a cabana and watch Sunset strip shimmer below.\r\n\r\n!(imgleft)/images/48.jpg (LA Story)! Or if you prefer things on a smaller scale, *The Avalon* (\"www.avalonbeverlyhills.com\":http://www.avalonbeverlyhills.com) has just 68 apartment-sized rooms on a residential street in Beverly Hills, a short walk from the nipped and tucked shoppers on Rodeo Drive. Features such as the original hourglass pool and the vintage and custom-designed furniture give it an artsy, rather than sceney, feel.\r\n\r\n*WHERE TO SHOP* If shopping is a religion, in LA they worship at *Fred Segal*. Three decades on, it’s still the celeb’s favourite shop to drop cash on labels as diverse as Martin Margiela and Juicy Couture. Unlike most department stores, the buyers will take a punt and stock emerging fashion designers, and at the yearly sale (usually late September) there’s 50 percent off everything.\r\n\r\nWith all those palatial homes needing furniture, showrooms like *Twentieth* (\"www.twentieth.net\":http://www.twentieth.net) are an integral part of the city. Tightly-curated, Twentieth mixes hard-to-find modernist pieces with African sculpture and fine art, and makes them into its own in-store mini installations. It sounds scary but it’s not – the store is a favourite for movie set designers and is constantly loaning out its hottest items. The favoured label with the city’s style-savvy starlets (and the wannabes), *Marc Jacobs* (\"www.marcjacobs.com\":http://www.marcjacobs.com) has not one, but three LA locations, all within a stiletto-friendly totter of each other. First up, the new Marc Jacobs boutique is crammed with antiques and has an opulent ‘30s feel. Over the road, the biggest Marc by Marc Jacobs store in the world sells his younger, less expensive diffusion line, and the accessories and homewares at Marc Jacobs Home gives the latent house hippie in all of us some cred.\r\n\r\n!(imgright)/images/50.jpg (LA Story)! For the boys, *Alpha* (\"www.alpha-man.com\":http://www.alpha-man.com) is the store for the whimsical to the practical and everything in between. It stocks everything from cufflinks to barbecues, to three-piece suits and sex toys; and has clothing from labels such as Y-3, Paul Smith and APC. In-house services include a stylist, event planner, closet organiser and interiors consultant.   \r\n\r\n*WHERE TO EAT* We’re not sure how much the line of Ferraris waiting for the valet messes with the feng shui, but as soon as you pass through the ornately carved gates at *Koi* (\"www.koirestaurant.com\":http://www.koirestaurant.com) all your earthly troubles should be left behind. Whether you sit in the dark and sultry dining room, the sunken lounge, or the bamboo-lined patio, the flickering votives and celebrity clientele should provide ample distraction until your perfectly cooked Asian fusion meal is delivered.\r\n\r\nFor those who would rather wolf down plates of robust and tasty food with glee, *A.O.C* (\"www.aocwinebar.com\":http://www.aocwinebar.com) is the place. The wildly popular ‘small plates’ restaurant has a wood-burning oven, an entire menu page devoted to cheese, and a charcuterie where cold meats of your choice are carved while you watch. As with every good place in LA, the long, loud bar has a smattering of celebs.\r\n\r\n[page]\r\n\r\nUnderstatement is not on the menu at *La Boheme* (\"www.cafe-laboheme.com\":http://www.cafe-laboheme.com), a cavernous dining room off Santa Monica Boulevard (the strip where Lee Tamahori was sprung). The velvet drapes, fi replace and opulent Italian crystal chandeliers evoke a gothic kind of opulence. You half expect to see Tony Soprano growling over his goblet at a group of Armaniclad gangsters.\r\n\r\n!(imgleft)/images/51.jpg (LA Story)! If you want to give your Jimmy Choos a rest for the evening and head out in your sneakers, (sorry, ‘trainers’) *Magnolia* (\"www.magnoliahollywood.com\":http://www.magnoliahollywood.com) on Sunset Boulevard has a cosy neighbourhood atmosphere without being twee. The chic interior is black and white with gold embossed walls, the menu anything from a toasted ham and cheese to lobster ravioli.   \r\n\r\n*WHERE TO DRINK* Provocative and absurd, the rooftop bar at *The Standard Downtown (\"www.standardhotel.com\":http://www.standardhotel.com) is worth a visit for the sheer LA-ness of it all. Lined with shagpile carpets and bright red Astroturf, it has bent banana loungers or vibrating waterbeds for reclining on as you watch movies projected onto the walls. With 360° views of downtown and the odd helicopter whirring past, it’s a bit like The Jetsons – on acid. \r\n\r\nAt the intersection of Las Palmas and the hot nightclubbing strip Hollywood Boulevard, *LAX* (\"www.laxhollywood.com\":http://www.laxhollywood.com) is an airport-themed club owned by superstar DJ and Nicole Richie’s sometimes squeeze, DJ AM. The doorman can be harsh and the youngish crowd snooty, but the interior is slick and inviting with mirrors shaped like aeroplane windows and an orb-shaped jellyfish tank. \r\n\r\nIf it’s not obvious from the dramatic white canopies visible from the Hollywood Walk of Fame or the limos clogging the street outside, *White Lotus* (\"www.whitelotushollywood.com\":http://www.whitelotushollywood.com) is another hipper-than-thou clubbing destination. Whether you’re on the tented patios, dancing around the circular bar or trying not to knock over the Asian antiques in the VIP areas, you’ll hardly be able to see the plebs for the celebs. It’s often worth making a reservation at the very good sushi restaurant to get automatic access to the bar. \r\n\r\n!(imgright)/images/52.jpg (LA Story)! And believe it or not, there are plenty of places to go out in LA that don’t have brutal door policies. A true gem is *Star Shoes* (\"www.starshoes.org\":http://www.starshoes.org), both a cocktail lounge and vintage shoe salon. Fitted out like a 1950s department store, you can sip cocktails, peruse the cases of vintage heels, or boogie on the tiny dance fl oor while a rockstar passing through town spins a spontaneous DJ set. A shoe shine costs $5.    \r\n\r\n*WHAT TO SEE* Without doubt, a visit to the *Getty Centre* (\"www.getty.edu\":http://www.getty.edu) is a compulsory part of any trip to LA. Set in Brentwood in the Santa Monica mountains, it has stunning views across the city and out to the Pacific. The expansive complex is made from creamy cleft cut Italian travertine, textured with fossilised leaves and feathers. The gardens are extraordinary and there are the five gallery pavilions filled with priceless art.\r\n\r\nTake an architectural tour around the *Walt Disney Concert Hall* (\"www.musiccentre.org/wdch\":http://www.musiccentre.org/wdch). The fourth addition to the Music Centre of Los Angeles, it houses the Philharmonic and Master Chorale and has a 2256 seat concert hall, outdoor amphitheatres and a myriad of rehearsal spaces. Designed by Frank Gehry, the mad, wavy stainless steel façade used almost ten million kilograms of primary steel in 12,500 pieces, with no two exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThe bright lights of the big city are exhibited, collected and preserved at the *Museum of Neon Art* (\"www.neonmona.org\":http://www.neonmona.org). From new works by up and coming artists, to a selection of vintage American beer signs, this museum pays homage to all that’s great in neon. Thanks to the museum and restoration group Lumens, LA has preserved much of its neon history. \r\n\r\nWhen you’re starting to think LA has no soul, a moment in the *Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels* (\"www.olacathedral.com\":http://www.neonmona.org) will convince you otherwise. Push through the enormous bronze doors and marvel at the soaring ceiling made of 12,000 panes of translucent alabaster. On Wednesdays the 6019-pipe organ bursts into action with a free lunchtime concert, which literally makes the building vibrate.  \r\n','	<p><strong>As the year drifts into autumn, we find ourselves California dreaming – sunshine, orange groves, movie Stars, cocktails round the pool&#8230; Make ours a Malibu.</strong></p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><em>Words by Katie Newton</em></p>\n\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>You know what it’s like before you’ve even been there.

With 360° views of downtown and the odd helicopter whirring past, it’s a bit like The Jetsons – on acid. </p>\n\n	<p>At the intersection of Las Palmas and the hot nightclubbing strip Hollywood Boulevard, <strong><span class=\"caps\">LAX</span></strong> (<a href=\"http://www.laxhollywood.com\">www.laxhollywood.com</a>) is an airport-themed club owned by superstar DJ and Nicole Richie’s sometimes squeeze, DJ AM. The doorman can be harsh and the youngish crowd snooty, but the interior is slick and inviting with mirrors shaped like aeroplane windows and an orb-shaped jellyfish tank. </p>\n\n	<p>If it’s not obvious from the dramatic white canopies visible from the Hollywood Walk of Fame or the limos clogging the street outside, <strong>White Lotus</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.whitelotushollywood.com\">www.whitelotushollywood.com</a>) is another hipper-than-thou clubbing destination. Whether you’re on the tented patios, dancing around the circular bar or trying not to knock over the Asian antiques in the <span class=\"caps\">VIP</span> areas, you’ll hardly be able to see the plebs for the celebs. It’s often worth making a reservation at the very good sushi restaurant to get automatic access to the bar. </p>\n\n	<p><img src=\"/images/52.jpg\" class=\"imgright\" title=\"LA Story\" alt=\"LA Story\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /> And believe it or not, there are plenty of places to go out in LA that don’t have brutal door policies. A true gem is <strong>Star Shoes</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.starshoes.org\">www.starshoes.org</a>), both a cocktail lounge and vintage shoe salon. Fitted out like a 1950s department store, you can sip cocktails, peruse the cases of vintage heels, or boogie on the tiny dance fl oor while a rockstar passing through town spins a spontaneous DJ set. A shoe shine costs $5.    </p>\n\n	<p><strong><span class=\"caps\">WHAT</span> TO <span class=\"caps\">SEE</span></strong> Without doubt, a visit to the <strong>Getty Centre</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.getty.edu\">www.getty.edu</a>) is a compulsory part of any trip to LA. Set in Brentwood in the Santa Monica mountains, it has stunning views across the city and out to the Pacific. The expansive complex is made from creamy cleft cut Italian travertine, textured with fossilised leaves and feathers. The gardens are extraordinary and there are the five gallery pavilions filled with priceless art.</p>\n\n	<p>Take an architectural tour around the <strong>Walt Disney Concert Hall</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.musiccentre.org/wdch\">www.musiccentre.org/wdch</a>). The fourth addition to the Music Centre of Los Angeles, it houses the Philharmonic and Master Chorale and has a 2256 seat concert hall, outdoor amphitheatres and a myriad of rehearsal spaces. Designed by Frank Gehry, the mad, wavy stainless steel façade used almost ten million kilograms of primary steel in 12,500 pieces, with no two exactly the same.</p>\n\n	<p>The bright lights of the big city are exhibited, collected and preserved at the <strong>Museum of Neon Art</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.neonmona.org\">www.neonmona.org</a>). From new works by up and coming artists, to a selection of vintage American beer signs, this museum pays homage to all that’s great in neon. Thanks to the museum and restoration group Lumens, LA has preserved much of its neon history. </p>\n\n	<p>When you’re starting to think LA has no soul, a moment in the <strong>Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.neonmona.org\">www.olacathedral.com</a>) will convince you otherwise. Push through the enormous bronze doors and marvel at the soaring ceiling made of 12,000 panes of translucent alabaster. On Wednesdays the 6019-pipe organ bursts into action with a free lunchtime concert, which literally makes the building vibrate.  </p>','As the year drifts into autumn, we find ourselves California dreaming – sunshine, orange groves, movie Stars, cocktails round the pool...

But for Gert Wingardh it was an opportunity to bring out the dynamite.*\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\n_Words Abby Trow\r\nPhotographs James Silverman_\r\n\r\n</txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a challenge. On a 700sqm plot set amid steep rock, the owners wanted to build a large, light and airy two-storey villa overlooking the rugged coastline south of Gothenburg on Sweden’s west coast. Stringent planning rules relating to height meant the most likely solution would be to construct a single-storey property. To find a way around the rules, the owners turned to award-winning architect Gert Wingardh, an ingenious thinker not easily fazed by regulations.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"418\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n“It was an awkward space, with steep rock at the back leading to a small road that serves the houses in this area,” explains Wingardh. “I designed the house in a V-shape, to make best use of the space. And because the owners wanted two storeys and planning rules mean walls can’t be more than 3.5m high, my solution was to blast into the rock with dynamite.” This meant Villa Astrid could literally be built upside-down, with the bedrooms on the lower floor and a big living area on the ground level with a terrace in front looking out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe design involved blasting down more than five metres to create a level surface, which took about a week. The two main sides of the house at the rear are built around a small, decked inner courtyard, off which are the bedrooms. The narrow rear walls of the ‘V’ then follow the lie of the rock up to the top of the plot. This has resulted in some rock appearing inside the house at several points – in the main bathroom, rock forms one of the walls, and it also creeps into a far corner of the living room. “It wasn’t a problem to incorporate the rock into the structure and it’s a very unusual feature where you find it protruding into some rooms,” says Wingardh. “Some villas are built to pacify nature but this project works with the dramatic natural location.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"419\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nEntering the building at ground level you find a guest room, then a vast two-sided, glass-walled space, with an open-plan kitchen and dining area and living room. A mezzanine study hangs over the far side of the living space, which is where the owners, who are both in the pharmaceuticals industry, work when they’re at home. “This house is interesting because from outside you can’t see what it is,” says Wingardh. “It’s only once you get inside that it reveals its three-level structure, if you include the hanging mezzanine.” A staircase, enclosed by a frosted glass wall instead of having a balustrade and handrail, leads down to the lower floor, where you find the master bedroom, two children’s rooms and two bathrooms. Although not as bright as the upper lever, floor to ceiling sliding glass doors in the bedrooms allow for plenty of ambient lighting. \r\n\r\nThe interior design is described as ‘warm Scandinavian’ by Wingardh. “It’s contemporary, with lots of sliding glass doors and big glass windows, plain white walls and an ash wood floor throughout.” The exception to this is the master bathroom, which has been clad with black slate to act as a dramatic contrast with the rest of the house. The kitchen is also made from ash, with a large black concrete worktop. For lighting, some halogen downlights have been installed but otherwise simple lamps provide illumination. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"420\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe interiors have been purposefully kept quite simple so as to let the huge rooms, high ceilings and acres of glass speak do the talking. The exceptional views also do away with the need for extraneous detail, such as billowing curtains or fancy wallpapers. “You get to watch the weather, which is a wonderful thing,” says Wingardh. “And at night-time, because the glass walls are at a slight angle, you get some wonderful reflections.”\r\nAs with all new-build Swedish houses, great attention has been paid to eco-friendliness, with double-glazing and low energy consuming underfloor heating. The house itself is built largely from concrete, including the roof, which was then clad with special insulating foam. It was then covered in pre-weathered black copper. “The result of cladding it twice is that it’s a very maintainable and safe building that is remarkably energy efficient,” says Wingardh. And in time, the black copper will start to turn green, making Villa Astrid even more a part of its surrounding environment. \r\n','	<p><strong>Building a spacious villa on a precarious rocky outcrop would have proven mission impossible for many architects.

Compared to many of the other pieces on show that dripped with brightly coloured stones and pearls, Last’s work was markedly understated. His heavy round pendants on simple wires needed a closer look before their workmanship became evident.\r\n\r\nLast is an ex-pat Australian who moved to Dunedin to teach jewellery-making at the local polytech five years ago. He and his wife took a punt on a half-time job at the institute, packed their bags and left their Australian township with the name that’s shorthand for the back of nowhere. “I was living in Wagga Wagga for Chrissakes,” Last laughs. “We just decided, yeah, well, we’ll give it a go. It was a change, I tell ya. One thing Dunedin does have is lots of weather, which is quite different from Wagga Wagga.” \r\n\r\nHe was trained in the use of precious metals, but these days he predominantly works with a more prosaic material: aluminium. “In the scheme of metals, aluminium is the most chameleon-like. You can make the metal do lots of different things,” he explains. “I found working with aluminium to be very freeing, because you can afford to be generous with it. Sometimes I’ll go down to the scrapyard and buy a 10kg block of aluminium and hack at it until there’s only half a kilo worth left.\r\n\r\n“If I want to colour it, I can use anodysing chemicals to colour it, so it looks like coloured metal, not painted metal. It’s quite a challenge to work with too, because you can’t treat it in the way you can other metals – you can’t solder it or weld it. I’ve actually taken a lot of techniques from engineering workshops.”\r\n\r\nLast, who has been making jewellery, as well as larger scale products like bowls and lights, for over 20 years, bases much of his recent work on the idea of phyllotaxis, the pattern of plant growth characterized by intersecting spiral geometry. Sunflowers and cactuses play a particularly strong role in his influences. \r\n\r\nThe idea came about through an evolution of ideas of his work. “About 10 years ago I was working on the idea of things that flew; aeroplanes, spaceships, birds, space junk…” he recalls. “Along the way, a lot of things that I was producing started to take on shapes that were quite plant-like. Eventually I began working on the idea of phyllotaxis. So I started out making space junk that looked like flowers, and ended up making flowers that looked like space junk.” \r\n\r\nLast uses computer modeling in the design process for his works, digitally ‘growing’ the shapes on screen before he renders them in metal. Although most of his jewellery is now made as exhibition pieces, a few production pieces are available through Masterworks gallery in Auckland. \r\n\r\n\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Metalsmith Andrew Last’s works capture the fleeting beauty of flowers in a much more enduring format.</strong></p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"410\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>At the Armstrong Prestige Jewellery Breakfast at this year’s Vodafone id Dunedin Fashion Week, Andrew Last’s jewellery stood out.

Only half-an-hour’s drive from the Chilean capital Santiago, a young professional couple and their three children have made a sloping 1,200-metre plot of land the site of their dream home. \r\n\r\n“Since we got married, we had been living on the other side of the hill,” says 30-year old Fabiana Raveau who works in product development for a department store. “For a long time we had been looking for a plot of land without finding any, until we finally came to have a look over here and my husband fell for the landscape.” It was as if the position and shape of the house was predetermined, with nature providing a 60-metre-long plain. “I was fascinated by the relief,” she says. “Thinking of the kind of house we could plan here”. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"81\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nChilean architect Felipe Assadi suggested the family build a house that was avant-garde, experimental, and organic, but still achievable within their limited budget. He told them it would take one year from when the project was started to when they could all enjoy a barbecue together in the courtyard of their finished home. “When there isn’t much money, there are three options,” he says. “The first one is to make things cheaply, the second is to make things badly, and the third one is to make things quickly. And since we didn’t like the first two options, we went for ‘quickly’.”\r\n\r\nIt’s a house that makes the most of its limited resources. When the family requested concrete, they knew an expensive finish would be out of the question so it was left rough. “The formwork is also different, made of a cheaper wooden sheet,” Assadi says. “These drawbacks have become advantages because they have forced me to undergo a different creative process and have provided the house with its unique character.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"82\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe architect and his clients really worked at understanding each other’s vision. “Felipe made a scale model for us and it was great,” says Fabiana. “It isn’t like with a plan, where you don’t understand much. We could visualize what our house would be like and we loved the project.” The architect says: “I had several advantages. My clients had very clear ideas about what they wanted: a spacious house with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a toilet, a play-room for the children, a social living-room and dining-room, plus a courtyard and kitchen. Also, the site already suggested a shape: a walk-in zigzag towards the river, meeting a flat area.”\r\n\r\nBuilt with both avant-garde and Povera sensibilities, the house is a real combination of the rustic and the minimalist. The first glimpse of it is a descending back façade made from wood covered in tar, hermetic and mysterious. This contrasts with a series of modern, bright orange dividing walls, the result of a happy accident. One day, the light from the west caught something orange that was sitting outside, making it glow beautifully. “So the place where a wooden or steel colour shade should have been has been painted orange,” says Assadi. “And it worked.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"83\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nOn one side is the entrance to the house, which opens onto a long ramp leading down to the ground floor living area. “The idea was to go into a kind of tunnel where you begin to realise you are getting into the insides of the hill through those horizontal lateral little windows,” he says. Fabiana says she was worried when this part of the building work began. “We didn’t know what material to make the ramp of,” she says. “And materials in general were expensive. We went once to Buenos Aires and saw at a restaurant this material called “fierro” and we really liked the sensation it conveyed. We had it priced there and the figure suited us.”\r\n\r\nThis long corridor has become like a 13-metre-long skateboarding rink for the children. One of the walls has been covered in zinc. “The diamond-polished sheath, or the zinc sheath plate, was used throughout building work to walk on,” says Assadi. “It used to make a lot of noise, it was a kind of scaffold and we thought it could have a more industrial character. The householder began fantasising about using it, something no client would have ever asked me, and we found its place in this access corridor.” The skylight brightens the bare, museum-like white walls.\r\nDown the ramp on the ground floor, the main façade faces the mountains and is located for maximum sun. The living area and bedrooms are very bright. Assadi says: “It has been one of my main concerns to provide an excellent view.” A huge window frames the view, bringing the light and colour of nature to temper and complement the austere interior.

It has been one of those cases where from the beginning of the design, the modules all fit and the heights were beautiful. It is a building I would like to continue developing. When I create a building I think about everything that has to be done and there is always an alternative way to solve things.” He gives the example of the metal ramp leading down to the lower levels of the house. “It is not about making strange things, but about giving options to the client,” he says. “This is what I call innovating.” \r\n\r\nAnd the owners are understandably pleased with the result. “The first feeling when we moved in was one of complete happiness,” says Fabiana. “This place is peaceful and has a magic aura for us. As a family we love nature and this house, with its transparencies and places that open to the exterior, with its movements on the plot of land and its textures. Wherever you look, it breathes beauty and communication with the environment.”','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words Paula Riveros<br />\nPhotographs Fernando Gómez/surpressagencia.com<br />\nStyling Mariana Rapoport</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>A house in the foothills of the Chilean Andes shows what is possible when a low budget is combined with an open mind.</strong></p>\n	<p>Set in the wilds of the Chilean Andes with the permanent murmur of the Mapocho River in the background, this simple, contemporary house makes a bold statement. Only half-an-hour’s drive from the Chilean capital Santiago, a young professional couple and their three children have made a sloping 1,200-metre plot of land the site of their dream home. </p>\n	<p>“Since we got married, we had been living on the other side of the hill,” says 30-year old Fabiana Raveau who works in product development for a department store. “For a long time we had been looking for a plot of land without finding any, until we finally came to have a look over here and my husband fell for the landscape.” It was as if the position and shape of the house was predetermined, with nature providing a 60-metre-long plain. “I was fascinated by the relief,” she says. “Thinking of the kind of house we could plan here”. </p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"81\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>Chilean architect Felipe Assadi suggested the family build a house that was avant-garde, experimental, and organic, but still achievable within their limited budget. He told them it would take one year from when the project was started to when they could all enjoy a barbecue together in the courtyard of their finished home. “When there isn’t much money, there are three options,” he says. “The first one is to make things cheaply, the second is to make things badly, and the third one is to make things quickly. And since we didn’t like the first two options, we went for ‘quickly’.”</p>\n	<p>It’s a house that makes the most of its limited resources. When the family requested concrete, they knew an expensive finish would be out of the question so it was left rough. “The formwork is also different, made of a cheaper wooden sheet,” Assadi says. “These drawbacks have become advantages because they have forced me to undergo a different creative process and have provided the house with its unique character.”</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"82\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>The architect and his clients really worked at understanding each other’s vision. “Felipe made a scale model for us and it was great,” says Fabiana. “It isn’t like with a plan, where you don’t understand much. We could visualize what our house would be like and we loved the project.” The architect says: “I had several advantages. My clients had very clear ideas about what they wanted: a spacious house with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a toilet, a play-room for the children, a social living-room and dining-room, plus a courtyard and kitchen. Also, the site already suggested a shape: a walk-in zigzag towards the river, meeting a flat area.”</p>\n	<p>Built with both avant-garde and Povera sensibilities, the house is a real combination of the rustic and the minimalist. The first glimpse of it is a descending back façade made from wood covered in tar, hermetic and mysterious. This contrasts with a series of modern, bright orange dividing walls, the result of a happy accident. One day, the light from the west caught something orange that was sitting outside, making it glow beautifully. “So the place where a wooden or steel colour shade should have been has been painted orange,” says Assadi. “And it worked.”</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"83\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>On one side is the entrance to the house, which opens onto a long ramp leading down to the ground floor living area. “The idea was to go into a kind of tunnel where you begin to realise you are getting into the insides of the hill through those horizontal lateral little windows,” he says. Fabiana says she was worried when this part of the building work began. “We didn’t know what material to make the ramp of,” she says. “And materials in general were expensive. We went once to Buenos Aires and saw at a restaurant this material called “fierro” and we really liked the sensation it conveyed. We had it priced there and the figure suited us.”</p>\n	<p>This long corridor has become like a 13-metre-long skateboarding rink for the children. One of the walls has been covered in zinc. “The diamond-polished sheath, or the zinc sheath plate, was used throughout building work to walk on,” says Assadi. “It used to make a lot of noise, it was a kind of scaffold and we thought it could have a more industrial character. The householder began fantasising about using it, something no client would have ever asked me, and we found its place in this access corridor.” The skylight brightens the bare, museum-like white walls.<br />\nDown the ramp on the ground floor, the main façade faces the mountains and is located for maximum sun. The living area and bedrooms are very bright. Assadi says: “It has been one of my main concerns to provide an excellent view.” A huge window frames the view, bringing the light and colour of nature to temper and complement the austere interior.

It certainly doesn’t care about contemporary art or contemporary music… it just exists and has its own system and its own life and we’re kind of passing through.” However, time is running out for Bizumic to contemplate New Zealand sunsets – he heads to Germany for the highly sought after 12-month Creative New Zealand Berlin residency in August.\r\n\r\nNo stranger to residencies, Bizumic has already worked in Paris, at the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery in New Plymouth and on the prestigious Frances Hodkins Fellowship in Dunedin. Born in Belgrade in 1977, he has lived in New Zealand for many years, although Vienna has been his base for most of the last two years. He has exhibited his art in Lithuania, Warsaw, Oslo, New York, London and Melbourne, and will take part in the upcoming Busan Biennale in South Korea. But the nature-lover is equally at home in the more secluded environs of Waiheke Island in Auckland’s Hauraki Gulf. \r\n\r\n“The idea of nature is a construct,” he asserts, adding that beauty is a mere fantasy humans project onto an indifferent environment. Although nature is something we equate with science, and therefore fact, Bizumic says nature is one of the many fictions we create to relate to our surroundings. “Fiction is part of reality, you can’t separate it. It’s essentially how you read things and how you relate to them, and that’s the beauty of art.” He is unconvinced by the way New Zealand is being marketed to tourists, saying that even something as seemingly untainted as a world heritage site is a construct that humans use to filter the way they relate to the world.\r\n\r\nSuspicious of any binary distinction between nature and man-made things, Bizumic prefers to look at examples where reality becomes fiction. His earlier works depict the highly manicured grounds of parks and golf courses, a tranquility entirely of our own making. Surprisingly, the glassy pond in A Beautiful Afterlife, his 2002 window installation at the Auckland Art Gallery, was in fact a sewerage treatment facility.\r\n\r\nWhile in Berlin Bizumic will be working on Seven Sister Cities, a multi-screen video work that will see him visiting Berlin’s sister cities (Istanbul, Moscow, Warsaw, Los Angeles, Paris, Budapest and Madrid) to collaborate with local artists. “I’m visiting green areas in these cities and I’m particularly interested in areas of the city where the green just exists without being designed by humans,” he says of the empty lots and other de facto green spaces that usually appear on the outskirts of a city. “It just kind of appears and has its own existence. Usually different cities have a green area, but we don’t realise how important it is. Like Central Park in Manhattan – you probably wouldn’t be able to breathe in New York without it.”\r\n\r\nIn considering the way we inhabit our surroundings, Bizumic is particularly interested in displacement. His 2004 work Aipotu considers the ruins of a modernist-style Norwegian whaling station built on Stewart Island in 1927. Another work proposes relocating Little Barrier Island – considered one of the world’s most important conservation islands – to the Harbour of Venice, a process he describes as reverse colonisation. “When Europeans came to New Zealand, essentially they brought a set of ideas and ideals of what the land should be like,” he explains. “You take this island, which is kind of untouched, and you take it to Europe – it’s kind of absurd. But if you come with an idea to make a place look like Europe, that’s not absurd. I think it is essentially the same thing.” \r\n\r\nAlthough Bizumic does not want to bludgeon his viewers with green-politics and does not see his work as being primarily motivated by environmental issues, he says there is an urgency about people taking global warming seriously. He no longer drives a car and has decided not to eat “anything that walks.” “Our experience of place in the 21st century is now affected by movement, history, cultural knowledge, extreme climate change and an increasingly \'virtual\' web of global communications.

Neo-baroque styling remains a favourite, with at least 10 different ‘re-visitations’ of the chandelier on show. Of particular note was the rubber-dipped chandelier by Tobias Wong for Citizen: Citizen. Colours also had a key role to play, from the gregarious offerings from Missoni Home to Panier, created for Kartell by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec: a jewel-like plastic ottoman presented in a plethora of colours. This sense of florid nostalgia sat alongside slick and minimal pieces like the covetable Vignelli chair from Heller: black, shiny, and sinisterly alluring, like Darth Vader’s helmet. Derin’s new Easy sofa takes the by-now predictable minimal corner suite and softens the edges, creating a new ‘inviting’ strain of minimalism that has been long in the coming. The New Zealand group Essenze stood out from the crowd. Their booth had the cosy, cluttered feel of the bach with David Trubridge’s warm timbers and Alison Henry’s luxurious accessories drawing icy glances from its minimalist neighbours and appreciative gazes from the buyers.

Completed two years ago, the house is now largely concealed by the native bush that has regenerated around it, nestling back into the branches of the nikau, rewarewa and ponga, just as its designers planned.\r\n\r\nThe house was Hillery and Greenslade’s debut project. “At that time we had pretty exciting ideals about everything. Fresh off the starting blocks from architecture school, being our first house, the project has a lot of energy and gusto,” says Hillery. Designed for a couple who work in the film industry, the house was put together on a modest budget, pushing its designers to conserve costs, while creating a house that is anything but conservative.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"78\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n“It was a complicated project,” Hillery admits. “The clients had been looking for a piece of land, and one day they called us up really excited, saying they’d found a fantastic site that they wanted us to come and look at it. I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ and was dreaming of a beautiful, flat, coastal site. And then we got out there and it was on a really steep slope and completely covered in bush.” She laughs. “It was a bit of a shock. But then Andrew climbed up a tree, and which revealed a stunning view out to the cityscape and Rangitoto. It became quite exciting.”\r\n\r\nDespite the house being positioned on an acre block, Hillery and Greenslade kept the structure’s footprint much smaller than the allowed size. “You don’t really want to be in a cavernous space on that site,” explains Hillery. “There’s a sense of intimacy to the house. There’s not a lot of wastage. It’s easy to move around in.” In deference to costs, and eco-friendliness, all the materials used in the house were sourced in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"79\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nFrom the start, the pair was given completely free rein; no specific brief was offered as the clients were respectful of Hillery and Greenslade’s conceptual intentions versus their more obvious needs and lifestyle. It was challenging, but exciting. “We wanted to create a dark and quite menacing form that nestled among the native trees, with the front living space floating out above the canopy. It’s as if there’s this panorama of luscious green carpet laid out before you, with plump te kereru and tui flying right past.”\r\n\r\nIn contrast to its bush-clad setting, the house is composed of decidedly man-made materials: Coloursteel iron, galvanized steel structure, steel kitchen and interior finishes, and GRC working surfaces.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"80\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n“We were interested in fusing industrial forms of manufacturing with domestic life,” says Hillery. “It’s not hostile, but there’s a juxtaposition between the house and the surroundings. That was totally our aesthetic at the time; well detailed, but not a lot of it. We wanted it to be dark. The clients were kind of creatures of the night, so most of the walls are chocolate brown, and some are even liquorice black.

The house is so specific to the site and to the needs of the client. It’s definitely the most compelling project I’ve been involved with so far.”','	<p><strong>The result of a slim budget and a challenging site, this intimate home in the Waitakere bush certainly embraces its dark side.</strong></p>\n	<p>Perched among the treetops of the Waitakeres like a giant, dark bird, this Sue Hillery and Andrew Greenslade house leans over the hillside on long, steel stilt-like legs and points its glass beak towards Rangitoto. Completed two years ago, the house is now largely concealed by the native bush that has regenerated around it, nestling back into the branches of the nikau, rewarewa and ponga, just as its designers planned.</p>\n	<p>The house was Hillery and Greenslade’s debut project. “At that time we had pretty exciting ideals about everything. Fresh off the starting blocks from architecture school, being our first house, the project has a lot of energy and gusto,” says Hillery. Designed for a couple who work in the film industry, the house was put together on a modest budget, pushing its designers to conserve costs, while creating a house that is anything but conservative.</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"78\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>“It was a complicated project,” Hillery admits. “The clients had been looking for a piece of land, and one day they called us up really excited, saying they’d found a fantastic site that they wanted us to come and look at it. I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ and was dreaming of a beautiful, flat, coastal site. And then we got out there and it was on a really steep slope and completely covered in bush.” She laughs. “It was a bit of a shock. But then Andrew climbed up a tree, and which revealed a stunning view out to the cityscape and Rangitoto. It became quite exciting.”</p>\n	<p>Despite the house being positioned on an acre block, Hillery and Greenslade kept the structure’s footprint much smaller than the allowed size. “You don’t really want to be in a cavernous space on that site,” explains Hillery. “There’s a sense of intimacy to the house. There’s not a lot of wastage. It’s easy to move around in.” In deference to costs, and eco-friendliness, all the materials used in the house were sourced in New Zealand.</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"79\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>From the start, the pair was given completely free rein; no specific brief was offered as the clients were respectful of Hillery and Greenslade’s conceptual intentions versus their more obvious needs and lifestyle. It was challenging, but exciting. “We wanted to create a dark and quite menacing form that nestled among the native trees, with the front living space floating out above the canopy. It’s as if there’s this panorama of luscious green carpet laid out before you, with plump te kereru and tui flying right past.”</p>\n	<p>In contrast to its bush-clad setting, the house is composed of decidedly man-made materials: Coloursteel iron, galvanized steel structure, steel kitchen and interior finishes, and GRC working surfaces.</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"80\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>“We were interested in fusing industrial forms of manufacturing with domestic life,” says Hillery. “It’s not hostile, but there’s a juxtaposition between the house and the surroundings. That was totally our aesthetic at the time; well detailed, but not a lot of it. We wanted it to be dark. The clients were kind of creatures of the night, so most of the walls are chocolate brown, and some are even liquorice black. The stained midnight brown floors sit in contrast to the white painted ceilings, which accentuates the pulling-up effect of the living room apex.” At night, the dark finishes recede, creating a reverse effect, with light shining out from the large glazed windows and the translucent fibreglass ‘skin’ of the bathroom cladding. “It’s like a lantern welcoming guests to the house,” says Hillery. </p>\n	<p>The approach to the house comes along a cantilevered timber jetty. “The procession down and across the exterior is all important.

Now his Glass House, an architectural icon for more than 50 years, will be preserved to inspire future generations.*\r\n\r\nIn 1949 Philip Johnson received his Masters degree in Architecture from Harvard University. For his thesis, he designed and subsequently built his dream house, inspired by Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe’s Farnsworth House. The Glass House, as he entitled it, catapulted forward the modernist movement in post-war America.\r\n\r\nWhen he built the Glass House at the age of 36, Phillip Johnson had already achieved success as a critic and a historian. Three years on, he went on to become the first director of the Department of Architecture at the Museum of Modern Art, fast tracking his career and world renown. Set in the woody enclave of New Canaan in the lush, eastern state of Connecticut, the Glass House is but one of 12 individual structures on Johnson\'s sprawling estate, each designed and overseen by the man himself. The house itself is shrouded in trees and retains a sense of privacy. Contrary to what you might expect, once inside you don’t feel overly exposed. Rather, you feel nestled and sheltered from the elements so at hand.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the building seems too extreme in its minimalism to have ever made a comfortable home. Paul Heyer, the author of American Architecture: Ideas and Ideologies in the Late Twentieth Century, called it “one of the world\'s most beautiful yet least functional houses.” However the fact that the architect used it as his sole residence for the final decade of his life seems to contradict early criticisms. Indeed, after spending time in the one large room, you come to appreciate the subtle nuances that would have made it such a haven.\r\n\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"112\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n“The house is, as the name suggests, a rectangle of glass and steel, the only solid structure on the inside being a circular chimney built of brick. On one half of the circle lies an open fireplace; the other half is the backdrop for a shower and a toilet. The kitchen area consists of one long, walnut cabinet. The usual eyesores of sink and stovetop are tucked away neatly in the kitchen version of a Murphy Bed. The furniture that Johnson chose at the house’s inception remains today, including the famous Mies van der Rohe Barcelona living room set.\r\n\r\nThe back of the house opens to a sweeping view of a valley below. At the foot of the rolling bank lies a pond that in turn houses a structure that looks like an arbor stretched out to the size of a maze.  From a distance, it appears castle-like and grandiose but as you approach you discover it is actually sized more for children. Johnson\'s knack of playing with perspective gives everything a slightly magical feel. The illusory \'Alice in Wonderland\' sensation you get at the pond’s edge truly pervades the estate.\r\n\r\nJohnson had plans to turn his property into a museum after his death and the last structure he built was to be the visitor’s centre. A small but formidable bunker of a building, he affectionately called it \'Tha Monsta\'. Other buildings on the grounds include a library that looks a little like a pod and a separate house situated across the road that he used for watching television. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"113\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nIt’s fitting that the person who designed the original sculpture garden for New York\'s Museum of Modern Art would be inspired enough to build one for himself. And the one on the Johnson estate is definitely one of the most striking buildings on the property. It boasts a glass ceiling of graphic panels that throw dramatic shadows across the room. A large conservatory separated by stairwells and hidden crevices, it is also home to some fabulous pieces of art. Until the property opens as a museum in April 2007 though, the hawks overhead remain the only ones with a view.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t always that way. Some of the greatest artists of a generation stayed at the property, including Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Frank Stella and Julian Schnabel. For all of them, it seems the property was more than a workshop. It was their playground. The castle on the pond was used for naked sunbathing and one can easily imagine Johnson turning on the fountain in the middle of the pond to set the scene for a fabulous party.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"115\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe guesthouse, rather smugly referred to as \'Andy\'s house,\' is the ultimate place to recover from an over-indulgent time. This rectangular room is made entirely of brick, in solemn contrast to The Glass House. It has three circular windows on the back wall, although once inside the bedroom, the wallpapered sliding screens can be moved to cover the windows creating a blackout effect. It could almost be said to feel like a large coffin, a feeling enhanced by the plush carpet and intense paisley print walls.\r\n\r\nJohnson defined a moment in 1932 when he organized a show at the Museum of Modern Art called International Style. The show helped introduce modern European architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier to America. Throughout his life Johnson continued to seek out new voices in architecture and in 1988 he organized the show Deconstructivist Architecture, featuring the architects Frank Gehry, Peter Eisenman, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and Daniel Libeskind. In 1979 he was recognized for his contribution to architecture when he won the first Pritzker Architecture Prize in recognition of 50 years of imagination and vitality embodied in a myriad of museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures.\r\n\r\nJohnson and his long time partner, David Whitney, were patrons of and collaborated with the major voices of their generation. Johnson had a longstanding relationship with the Modern Museum of Art and was on the team that redesigned the architecture wing, which was then named after him. A longstanding member of the board, he became the second largest individual contributor when he donated about half of his private collection, shortly before his death. Among this collection were Andy Warhol\'s Marilyn Monroe and Jasper Johns\' American Flag. As an architect, Johnson has left a legacy that will stand and speak for itself for many more years. As a patron of design and art, his influence is less visible, but will last even longer.','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p>_Words and Fashion Kathryn Neale<br />\nPhotography Jason Grank Rothenburg</p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>Architect Philip Johnson was one of the defining forces in American modernist architecture.

Johnson had a longstanding relationship with the Modern Museum of Art and was on the team that redesigned the architecture wing, which was then named after him. A longstanding member of the board, he became the second largest individual contributor when he donated about half of his private collection, shortly before his death. Among this collection were Andy Warhol&#8217;s Marilyn Monroe and Jasper Johns&#8217; American Flag. As an architect, Johnson has left a legacy that will stand and speak for itself for many more years. As a patron of design and art, his influence is less visible, but will last even longer.</p>\n\n ','   ','   \n\n ','/images/115.jpg','mag-article','issue34',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','american-dream','','','','','','','','','','','0ce723ce341ab8ea3178b3c0f15558f2','2006-09-22'),(72,'2006-09-21 10:45:00','dean','2007-11-02 14:50:21','graeme.bryan','Designday detail','','!/images/89.gif!\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nJoin us on Saturday 11 November for an exclusive tour of Auckland’s leading furniture and interiors showrooms, featuring inspirational installations by New Zealand’s top fashion designers. \r\n\r\nOn the day, you’ll be able to sample food and wine, check out the latest arrivals from the 2006 Milan Salone del Mobile and borrow interiors ideas from our country’s design and fashion gurus.

Shanghai: the city that the whole world is watching.*\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immaculate waif from the Shanghai Urban Planning Centre is gesturing with a bird-boned hand at the sprawling city model before her. She\'s explaining that in less than four years, almost seven square kilometres of city is going to be razed, studded with all manner of buildings and pavilions and populated with millions of worker bees, volunteers, tourists and delegates, in time for the World Expo 2010. It seems an impossibly tall order. “Shanghai,” she assures us, “will be ready.”\r\n\r\nIf a public servant in New Zealand tried to spin that yarn, it\'d be met with a healthy dose of disbelief and eyeball rolling. Yet, in Shanghai, no one doubts it will be done. The mega-tropolis of 17 million people is well-versed in large-scale change, and has developed lightning-quick reflexes to cope. From the dynastic upheavals of ancient history to the 20 th century\'s foreign occupations, cultural revolution and most recently, the Open Door policy, this city has proven that it\'s at its storming best in the face of uncertainty. \r\n\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"121\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nIn just 150 years, Shanghai has risen from a scattering of swampy fishing villages to become one of the most exciting cities on the planet. Much like in the \'20s and \'30s when it was a popular foreign outpost for the Brits, French and Americans, it is being celebrated once again, for its dizzying pace of life, cosmopolitan culture and unparalleled opportunities to make a pot of gold. Not even the political strangulation of the cultural revolution or the subsequent 50-year-long neglect of its infrastructure, saw the city lose any perceptible measure of its enterprise, ambition or sass. \r\n\r\nTo walk down the street in Shanghai is to experience an assault on the senses. The summer heat steams you like a dumpling, awakening cloying, pungent aromas that waft past at unpredictable intervals. A brownish smog muffles the sky, like gauzy cotton wool stretching into every crevice. Despite a seemingly fruitless struggle to reach ground level, the ladies of Shanghai protect themselves from the rays of the sun by carrying pastel parasols and tying delicate lace capes around their shoulders to maintain their perfect, fashionable white complexions. At street level, proceedings buzz along with the same pep and intensity as they do in many other large Asian cities; It’s when you gaze upwards that you start to realise the extent to which hungry developers have made their mark on this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"120\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe most brazen display of upward mobility can be seen in Pudong, on the eastern side of the city. In 1991, the area was little more than a swampy collection of fishing villages tumbling muddily into the Huangpu River, but was earmarked for development by the Shanghai Development Corporation, to become a new business sector for the city. Fast forward 15 years, and Pudong’s got a skyline straight out of Bladerunner – rows and rows of giant skyscrapers, fighting for airspace in a tangle of glass and steel. There\'s the triple globes of the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, the haughty glint of the golden Aurora and the 88 storey pagoda-style Jin Mao; the tallest of them all until it will be knocked off its perch by the World Finance Centre next year. During the day, the buildings fade into a tangle in the murk, and at night, they become a fantastical array of winking multi-coloured lights. Street level at Pudong is oddly unsettling for a new pedestrian - wide, multi-laned roads readily maroon you, and there’s no shortage of facetious white-gloved officials to stop you taking photos on the footpath. \r\n\r\nAcross the river, squaring off against the spectacle, are the solid granite facades of the Bund, Shanghai\'s other famous skyline. It is here that the financial and commercial hub of the city arose at the turn of last century – a wall of neo-classical architecture that wouldn\'t look out of place in the heart of London. Most recognisable is the clocktower of the Park Hotel, until the \'80s, the tallest building in the city. But its now easily dwarfed by spiky new neighbours. The Bund is still the widest street in Shangahi, lined on one side with hawkers and shoe shines, and on the other, boutiques like Armani and Dolce & Gabbana. The growing ex-pat community and the fattening wallets of the upper class locals have demanded a spruce-up, and you can just as easily find a fine fillet steak and bottle of Cloudy Bay Sauvingnon Blanc as you can a greasy bag of Peking duck. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"118\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nWesterners will find the neighbourhood of the French Concession among the most charming; it\'s got just the right mix of history, boutiques and restaurants, yet a glance down any side street will give a fascinating view of Chinese street life with lines of washing pegged out to dry and lanterns hanging in the windows. The low-rise residential architecture still seems relatively authentic, if that is indeed a relevant value in this city where the past slips so quickly from view that you are left wondering if it was ever really there to begin with. \r\n\r\n“Hysterical preservationists” are what architect Ben Wood calls the new breed of do-gooders that have appeared to try and preserve what’s left of the inner city’s original character. His heavily criticised French Concession development of Xintiandi has been involved restoring two blocks of shikumen (or stone-gate) housing, keeping the facades and hand hammered granite paving but populating the interiors with expensive boutiques and swish restaurants. Thousands of people were “relocated” to outlying apartment blocks but Wood insists they were fairly compensated. But now, few working class Shanghaiese could even afford a cup of coffee here. \r\n\r\nAs the only architect approached about the development that didn’t want to tear every last building down, Wood is miffed by the criticism. He points out that culture lives through people, not buildings, and that preserving them is a Western idea. Considering the speed of change in Shanghai, one wonders if indulging in nostalgia is just not an option. \r\n\r\n','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words Katie Newton<br />\nPhotography Simon Devitt</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>It&#8217;s the epicentre of China&#8217;s burgeoning economy, known for its razzle dazzle style.

St Andrew’s Beach, on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula, is one of few coastlines in Australia where houses may be built on the dunes. While idyllic during the best summer months, the site reveals its bi-polar nature when on-shore storms and wind chill send winter temperatures below freezing. Fortunately, the clients were inspired by this opportunity to escape their ‘artificial’ city lives, spent always in a world regulated to 22ºC. Their plan was that submersion in nature and her climate would remind them how it felt to be human.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"143\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe house – perched on slender legs so that dunes and vegetation remain untouched – takes its role as facilitator seriously. Lifting the box has the perverse implication of exposing it completely to the elements, inciting a particularly tough response. “By elevating it,” Godsell explains, “it had to be robust in its appearance because suddenly, instead of having an intimate conversation with the trees around the building, it was in dialogue with the ocean and the horizon.” The resulting form is a 43m long box, clad in rusted steel grating on each of its long edges, with the short sides left open; a human-scale telescope aimed at the beach view. \r\n\r\nTwo discrete pavilions are installed within the homogenous steel wrapping, one housing a living space, and the other a ‘barcode’ of bedrooms and baths. Transit between the spaces occurs in the open-air gap between the building’s solid walls and its mesh skin. At each end of the telescope, large decks sit within the folded steel, with full-height glazed doors opening like giant lenses to expose the interiors to the air. At the extremes of each end, Corten steel ‘benches’ provide lateral bracing and protection from the drop below.\r\n	\r\nGodsell is famous for his buildings’ skins. Essentially a protective device, they filter direct light and diffuse radiant heat, creating an otherworldly interior condition that’s become his signature. Past projects spawned the fine timber battening, which thanks to imitation – that greatest form of flattery – is now seen everywhere. The steel grating that this extreme setting demanded adds another layer of complexity to the skin’s effect. It appears solid from an oblique angle yet is transparent when square-on, the ‘shimmer’ between solid and void establishing a spatial complexity that belies the supposedly straightforward box.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"144\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n	\r\nThe oscillation between containment and release is accentuated when large vertical panels of skin are manually pivoted in place, allowing winter sun to flood the long, sunward elevation. The benefits of fine-tuning sunlight notwithstanding, the great achievement of these dynamic brise-soleils is the drama of the building’s changability. “Drama in architecture is profound because that’s when it speaks most loudly,” Godsell enthuses. “You can actually provoke an emotional response in the person who’s visiting the building.”\r\n	\r\nFrom afar, the building appears as anything but a house. It seems to have landed on the site rather than be floating there. The spaceship metaphor is hard to resist, considering the access stair that hangs from the building’s underbelly to the ground. It could as easily be seen as a rusted relic decaying on the shoreline, or an injured square-edged limb dressed with steel gauze. Its careful placement on a four-legged ‘cradle’ even feels curatorial, like a precious object or artefact is on display. This ‘object-ness’ is enhanced by the operation of the opening wall panels, making an up-scaled toy of the box that is played by the human hand. \r\n	\r\nGodsell’s practice has also spent years exploring the veranda, both in ideological and physical terms. The veranda is essentially a Colonial device that was tacked onto buildings wherever the British went to protect the architecture they imported from radiant heat. “In the Australian condition it becomes iconic,” Godsell explains. “It has a meaning beyond its use. If you extract it and analyse it, it is full of non-specific spaces and uses. It’s fluid and undefined. It suits the fact that Australians live in a very informal way.” The veranda is abstracted in this house both as a protective mechanism that shields the entire building, and as the in-between spaces that move you from one room or pavilion to another. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"145\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n	\r\nGodsell sees the veranda as the site of overlap between the architectures of Australia’s cultural past (Europe) and geographical future (Asia). Chinese and Japanese houses feature veranda elements also, and the inherent fluidity of Asian buildings resonates with the Australian institutions of sunroom, breezeway and sleep-out that each get reworked in this project. The connection Godsell seeks between past and future, Europe and Asia, are more than theoretical fancy. It is the mutual inclusion of these cultural conditions that might bear a genuine Australian architecture to house the future. “That’s our role,” he asserts. “To observe where our society’s headed and to design and construct buildings accordingly.”\r\n	\r\nWith the house at St Andrews, Godsell has added another signpost to mark the course of his significant career. Few architects have the resolve or the courage to treat their work as research. Godsell understands that his role is far greater than providing elite houses for elite clients. His work is a genuine attempt to explore the quandaries of culture, identity and sustainability. “If architects have got one common problem around the world,” he concludes, “it’s the problem of good environmental design.” It’s no wonder he’s the architects’ architect.\r\n','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words Jarrod Haberfield<br />\nPhotography Earl Carter</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>Simple at first glance, Sean Godsell’s award-winning beach house on Australia’s Mornington Peninsula gradually reveals layer after layer of complexity.</strong></p>\n	<p>Since forming his eponymous Melbourne practice in 1994, Sean Godsell has devoutly followed one line of architectural research. “What I decided to do,” he begins,“ was deliberately describe a particular architectural context within which to work that wasn’t predominately about form, that was about the destruction of the box.” This pursuit sees his work easily underestimated, and operating with this seemingly straightforward approach is dangerous ground. “If you don’t pull it off,” Godsell offers, “you run a high risk of it just being a dumb box.”</p>\n	<p>The inherent rigour of his trademark tactic is not missed by his peers however; his latest house on St Andrews beach won this year’s Robin Boyd Award, the Australian Institute of Architect’s gong for the country’s best new house.

So long gone in fact, that even solution to the problem – the “design hotel” – has had time to experience a nasty backlash of its own. Criticisms range from the gouging prices charged for the boutique-brewed spirits in the mini bar to the way comfort and service seem to have given way to provocative art or expensive toothbrush holders.

For the viticulturists, the hotel is at the centre of a larger complex dubbed The City of Wine, which includes tasting rooms and century-old wine caves. The truly dedicated can even have “wine therapy” at the hotel’s in-house spa, involving soaking in a barrel-like tub while wine extracts are bubbled around you.

My husband and I chose our apartment in New York specifically because we retained sole rights to a private oasis on high. I must admit though that ours, replete with the half-orb barbeque and a blow-up kiddie pool, need bow its head in the face of architect Matthew Baird’s slickly conceived outdoor living space. Baird’s open fireplace and bench seating around a decked courtyard might just be the perfect setting to watch the sun set over Manhattan.\r\n	\r\nMatthew Baird always knew he wanted to design buildings. His grandfather was an architect who started a family practice in central Pennsylvania, which developed into a well-established regional business. After the 1920s, Baird’s grandfather struck out on his own and made a name for himself in New York, but eventually returned to the family practice. Clearly this sensibility has passed on through the generations. “He was an architect and he had a great life doing it. I always remembered that,” Baird recalls.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"178\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n	\r\nBaird received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University and a Masters from Columbia, both in the field of architecture. He worked as the project architect on New York’s Museum of Folk Art through 2001 before leaving the firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien to start out on his own. Within a year he was approached about designing a rundown townhouse in New York’s now uber-hip Meat-Packing District. It was a dream project: a chance to build from the ground up. The client, however, was interviewing so many big name architects, that Baird considered his chances slim. But when the call came, the voice said, “I have good news and bad. The good news is you got the job. The bad news is we’re leaving in five days for a ski trip and we want to see a scheme before we go.” \r\n	\r\nBaird didn’t hear anything after ‘You got the job’. “I was on the moon.” With next to no time to prepare, instinct came to the rescue. “I just sat down and drew exactly what I thought should be built here. I did one scheme. I showed it to her, and the scariest part was that she simply said, ‘I love it. When do we start?’” \r\n	\r\nThe brief was to turn a rough and tumble, abandoned former butchery, circa 1956, into a townhouse that reflected the then gritty, industrial neighborhood. “The house was located in the meat packing district just a couple of years before it became The Meat Packing District,” says Baird (a seismic, almost overnight change, as any who have seen the area lately can testify). “When I came up with the façade, it was pretty distinct. I wanted an abstract combination of planes. I was also interested in materiality relative to the area.” Baird remembers: “The building was just falling in on itself. It was a total wreck.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"179\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n	\r\nRecalling his experience on the 30,000 sq ft Museum of Folk Art, Baird knew taking on the project meant being there “from the first sketch to the final punch list, making it happen.” This project shared many similarities and he quickly relied on the same hands-on approach. Looking at the building today on its pretty, cobblestone street, you can’t help but smirk. The intense concrete façade interrupts the quaint brownstones and the self-congratulatory cognoscenti ambling into the nearby chic bistro Pastis and members-only club SoHo House.\r\n	\r\nThe back of the building is essentially naked, providing a stark juxtaposition. Excited to explore the “duality of the solid façade and this open back,” Baird designed the entire back wall as one giant panel of glass, creating a picture-perfect view of the quintessential New York courtyard. “Often people come by and from the exterior of the front they are like, ‘Wow, it must be pretty dark in there.’ Then you open it up and all of a sudden it’s flooded with light. That experience was designed into the house, to have that sort of surprise.” The concrete façade at the front of the house is attached with striking steel girders. Recessed windows afford the occupants diagonal views of the street but contribute further to the misconception of the place as a secretive hide-away.\r\n	\r\nWhen asked about the structural difficulties of affixing a metal sheet one-and-a-half inches thick and three stories high to a building, Baird laughs. “I remember waking up at least twice and thinking, ‘Have I sent those dimensions to the structural engineer?’ So I would, over and over again. He finally called me to say, ‘If you send these one more time, I’ll think you’re nuts!’” The plate, made from poured concrete, weighs over 17 tonnes. Baird deadpans, “It’s a little complicated how we attached it. The registration had to be perfect.” \r\n	\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"180\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the house, Baird wanted to test new materials with bold ideas. “We didn’t want anything pristine. I’d shown them a few projects and they liked the experimental materiality of our work. As an architect I am interested in investigating and trying to do things with new materials that haven’t been done before. The staircase in this house is made of cast polyurethane - the same stuff rollerblade wheels are made of.”\r\n	\r\nAt 600sq ft, each floor of the house is quite shallow, so Baird endeavored to keep the planes as open as possible. The sub-street level media room has a 20ft roof that breaks into the ground floor. A balcony from the first floor offers vertiginous vistas from on high. Indeed, being able to see from floor to floor, through open stairwells or where a floor/ceiling would typically be, is a recurring feature. The issue of a five-floor house having no elevator came up but “the couple were so young and full of energy,” that the idea of an unwieldy lift was quickly quashed. \r\n	\r\nIt’s fitting then that the overriding feeling of the house is one of energy. On the day Urbis shot the house, the children who live there ran up and down the open stairs with abandon. Even the crew couldn’t resist climbing a few extra stairs to eat lunch on the roof. Maybe it’s because possibilities of life seem endless when the view from your courtyard stretches across the world’s most vibrant city, all the way to the horizon.','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words and styling Kathryn Neale<br />\nPhotography Jason Frank Rothenberg</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>From industrial factory to dream apartment, this New York home led the charge for going upmarket in downtown.</strong></p>\n	<p>I confess to being obsessed with rooftops.

When do we start?’” </p>\n	<p>The brief was to turn a rough and tumble, abandoned former butchery, circa 1956, into a townhouse that reflected the then gritty, industrial neighborhood. “The house was located in the meat packing district just a couple of years before it became The Meat Packing District,” says Baird (a seismic, almost overnight change, as any who have seen the area lately can testify). “When I came up with the façade, it was pretty distinct. I wanted an abstract combination of planes. I was also interested in materiality relative to the area.” Baird remembers: “The building was just falling in on itself. It was a total wreck.”</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"179\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>Recalling his experience on the 30,000 sq ft Museum of Folk Art, Baird knew taking on the project meant being there “from the first sketch to the final punch list, making it happen.” This project shared many similarities and he quickly relied on the same hands-on approach. Looking at the building today on its pretty, cobblestone street, you can’t help but smirk. The intense concrete façade interrupts the quaint brownstones and the self-congratulatory cognoscenti ambling into the nearby chic bistro Pastis and members-only club SoHo House.</p>\n	<p>The back of the building is essentially naked, providing a stark juxtaposition. Excited to explore the “duality of the solid façade and this open back,” Baird designed the entire back wall as one giant panel of glass, creating a picture-perfect view of the quintessential New York courtyard. “Often people come by and from the exterior of the front they are like, ‘Wow, it must be pretty dark in there.’ Then you open it up and all of a sudden it’s flooded with light. That experience was designed into the house, to have that sort of surprise.” The concrete façade at the front of the house is attached with striking steel girders. Recessed windows afford the occupants diagonal views of the street but contribute further to the misconception of the place as a secretive hide-away.</p>\n	<p>When asked about the structural difficulties of affixing a metal sheet one-and-a-half inches thick and three stories high to a building, Baird laughs. “I remember waking up at least twice and thinking, ‘Have I sent those dimensions to the structural engineer?’ So I would, over and over again. He finally called me to say, ‘If you send these one more time, I’ll think you’re nuts!’” The plate, made from poured concrete, weighs over 17 tonnes. Baird deadpans, “It’s a little complicated how we attached it. The registration had to be perfect.” </p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"180\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>For the rest of the house, Baird wanted to test new materials with bold ideas. “We didn’t want anything pristine. I’d shown them a few projects and they liked the experimental materiality of our work. As an architect I am interested in investigating and trying to do things with new materials that haven’t been done before. The staircase in this house is made of cast polyurethane &#8211; the same stuff rollerblade wheels are made of.”</p>\n	<p>At 600sq ft, each floor of the house is quite shallow, so Baird endeavored to keep the planes as open as possible. The sub-street level media room has a 20ft roof that breaks into the ground floor. A balcony from the first floor offers vertiginous vistas from on high. Indeed, being able to see from floor to floor, through open stairwells or where a floor/ceiling would typically be, is a recurring feature. The issue of a five-floor house having no elevator came up but “the couple were so young and full of energy,” that the idea of an unwieldy lift was quickly quashed. </p>\n	<p>It’s fitting then that the overriding feeling of the house is one of energy. On the day Urbis shot the house, the children who live there ran up and down the open stairs with abandon. Even the crew couldn’t resist climbing a few extra stairs to eat lunch on the roof. Maybe it’s because possibilities of life seem endless when the view from your courtyard stretches across the world’s most vibrant city, all the way to the horizon.</p>\n\n ','','\n\n ','/images/200.jpg','mag-article','issue36',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','high-and-mighty','','','','','','','','','','','04be2d779ab9d20f404a05bf24f2c5cc','2007-01-22'),(101,'2007-01-23 08:24:00','gabrielle.mirkin','2007-01-26 13:31:27','gabrielle.mirkin','Public Display of Collection','','<txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\n\r\n</txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\n*The display structures at the new Blumhardt Gallery are as much a work of design as the collections they hold.*\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"171\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nWhen Wellington architects Sam Kebbell and John Daish, and industrial designers Robert Greig and Bernd Benninghoff were commissioned to design the exhibition furniture for the Dowse’s new Blumhardt gallery for New Zealand applied arts and design, they took the brief literally. “There’s a lot of discussion in the design industry about ‘raising the bar’ but we thought the bar was already high, which is why someone like Doreen Blumhardt wanted to create a gallery,” Kebbell explains. “Our response was to see this work as holding up the bar or sustaining it.

Following the devastating 1923 earthquake and the Second World War bombings, Tokyo was substantially rebuilt in a style that relied heavily on modernist influences, and many Western architects were commissioned for significant public and residential projects. And although much of the work by luminaries Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier no longer survives – Lloyd Wright’s Imperial Hotel, Aisaku Hayashi House and Arinobo Fukuhara House have all been destroyed or demolished, though Le Corbusier’s monolithic National Museum of Western Art still has iconic status – their influence is still highly visible, even amid the many cranes that tell of the city’s continual frantic growth.\r\n\r\nNot everyone is enamoured of Tokyo’s embrace of Western architecture. Locals debate the effects of progressive development on the city’s aesthetics, with many preferring to protect the old cultural Tokyo that is so marketable to the much-needed foreign tourist. However, the way the locals conduct themselves can be considered culturally worthy in itself, and the rise in architectural development around this progressive city will continue to attract a new breed of tourist: those interested in seeing consumerism at its grandest.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"182\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nConsumer culture is huge in Tokyo, particularly that based on Western ideals of status. This is where you will find the most impressive displays of architectural splendour. Louis Vuitton, Prada, Hermes, Tod’s, Chanel, even Dean & Deluca, are all represented here and housed in monumental shrines to the respective brands. This new style of architectural glamour has been labelled “luxitecture” – luxury brands housed in purpose-built luxury buildings.\r\n\r\nIt’s a visual feast to walk down Otomesando Avenue and be bombarded by these masterpieces. Each of the luxury houses appears motivated by the challenge of outdoing the neighbours. Employing the prowess of internationally acclaimed architects Herzog & de Meuron has paid off for Prada, with its showroom arguably the newest and most visually impressive of the bunch.\r\nDriving through the narrow winding residential streets that run between the larger shopping areas, you see an interesting mix of low-rise apartment blocks and small individual dwellings, many of which are constructed from intricate brick work or modernist tilt slab concrete. The long of residents for a touch of green in this concrete jungle is evident everywhere, with balconies and roof terraces crammed with the ubiquitous bonsai. You can easily imagine that this was the real purpose for these miniature trees: providing the city dweller with their very own manicured version of the country.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"184\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nWhere to Stay:\r\nHotel Claska\r\nLocated in the up-and-coming design district of Meguro, Claska is one of the few genuinely boutique hotels in Tokyo. Designed by the locally acclaimed Intentionallies architecture practice, the hotel offers nine individual suites, each with its own aesthetic.

The latest luxury building to be completed in Tokyo definitely gives the neighbours a run for their money. The honeycombed exterior stands tall in an otherwise quiet boutique shopping area. \r\nwww.prada.com\r\nTod’s \r\nAny true architecture fan or avid shopper would greatly enjoy the walk from the quieter streets of the Aoyama (where the Prada building is located) through to the madness that is Omotesando Avenue. Here you’ll find a magnificent collection of luxitecture from Chanel to Dior to Gucci, as well as the Tod’s building by the famous Toyo Ito. If it’s head-turning architecture you’re after, the Tod’s building achieves this and then some. The glass exterior is clad with criss-crossing steel structures, which give the graphic representation of the zelkova trees that line the streets below.\r\nwww.tods.com\r\nLouis Vuitton Roppongi Hills\r\nThe newly opened Roppongi Hills store is a welcome sight for the jaded. Its exterior is clad with 30,000 glass tubes designed to reflect the famous Louis Vuitton monogram motif, and the store is shaped like a large glass box that’s reminiscent of another of the brand’s icons – the trunk suitcase. Touted as the only true luxury showroom to inhabit this newly constructed neighbourhood, it’s clear that the locals want to rid themselves of the Roppongi district’s once renowned sleazy reputation.\r\nwww.louisvuitton.com\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"183\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nWhere to Shop:\r\nL’eclaireur\r\nIf you’re looking for the best of the dark and moody fashion designers, head straight to L’eclaireur.

Once in, you’ll find the most exquisitely edited selection of Rick Owens, Ann Demeulemeester, Dior Homme and Number Nine, to name a few. Catering for both boys and girls, this is a one-stop cool shop.\r\nwww.leclaireur.jp\r\nLoveless\r\nThis haven of craziness is well worth the descent down the dark and ominous staircase. On the first floor down, you can stop for a much-needed espresso at the counter while you browse through an eclectic mix of books, music and (the ever-present in Tokyo) action figurines.

Due to its similarity to the Eiffel Tower, it could easily have you thinking you were in Paris. Not that one should go to Beige for the views alone, of course.

Hair was teased, skirts ballooned, wallets were stuffed with cash, muscles bulged and shoulder pads were huge. And if you couldn’t make something bigger, you just made it flashier. And when Mark Lindale bought this 1980s house in Herne Bay, it was obvious that previous owners had followed that dictate to the nth degree.\r\n\r\nOwned at one time by the Sultan of Brunei’s brother and completely redecorated in anticipation of his visit that never eventuated, the house was a tribute to maximalist flashiness and conspicuous consumerism. Brass trim, indoor fountains, pinky-peach carpet, red-tiled bathrooms and a bath shaped like a pair of giant swan wings were just a few of the wonders (horrors?) that Lindale got as part of the package when he bought the house three and a half years ago. A rambling structure, with five bedrooms, five bathrooms, three expansive living areas, a generous foyer, gym and even a full indoor squash court, it was ripe for some serious modernisation.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"237\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n	\r\nOriginally, Lindale planned to divide the building into two townhouses, but after living in it for a while, he started to see the potential hiding under the layers of bling, and decided to renovate it instead. To help, he turned to interior designer Natalie Boyle and architects Lance Herbst and Nicky Meiring. All three admit to some initial horror at the house’s interiors. “It was amazingly tacky,” laughs Herbst. “Inside the house was just all wrong because it had been worked over a couple of times. The time that it was done for the Sultan of Brunei’s brother was when all the brass and the gold and the gaudy colours came in, so it was really pretty bad. And then it was overlaid with terracotta on the decks, which was obviously from a previous incarnation. All in all, there were a lot of jarring languages.”\r\n	\r\nInitially the planned scale of the renovation was relatively tame – just the kitchen, carpets and curtains – but a more fundamental disaster was uncovered when the walls were torn out in preparation for the new kitchen. “When we opened up the walls, we found some pretty serious ingress of water,” says Herbst. “That was a big shock. The house was actually quite shoddily put together. The client just wanted to do a bit of refurb but there was some major structural and waterproofing work that had to happen first.”\r\n	\r\nWith the decision made to take on a full-scale renovation, Herbst and Meiring decided not to attempt to disguise the house’s ‘80s heritage, but instead to play it up, and turn it into something that Don Johnson would have been proud to live in during his Miami Vice years. “Primarily, we were playing into the positive aspects of what was already here. Because there were some very good bones and it was a case of distilling out of that what the good stuff was,” Herbst explains. “Instead of trying to overlay something on it again, we tried to strip it back and find the right language and materials. And achieve consistency, which was something that it lacked because it had been worked over so often. It was really just an opportunity to give it what it was due.” \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"238\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n	\r\nBoyle says one of the first decisions made was to keep the colour palette very neutral. “We tried to keep everything kind of black, white and chrome. Mark’s existing art collection was quite amazing, so we really wanted to create big blank spaces that would showcase the pieces. We didn’t want to create a cluttered or colourful environment.” The kitchen, which was already underway when the decision was made to extend the renovations, was the starting point. The cabinetry, by Poliform from Studio Italia, was kept to simple black, and the “awful, overlaid, beachy flooring” was replaced with white-stained American oak. “We spent a long time getting the right colour. CTC Flooring probably did about 20 samples for us before we got it right.” The kitchen was also where the choice was made to bring back a 1980s staple – glass bricks. “That was a big take-a-breath decision,” admits Herbst. “But they actually worked very well. In the original house, there were lots of curves, but all the windows were straight, so when we replaced them with glass blocks, we were able to follow the lines of the curves.”\r\n	\r\nThe next point of focus was what Boyle refers to as “the boys’ room” downstairs: a games room complete with pool and poker tables. “We were doing a lot of work with Poliform so we got them to make a huge custom seating piece, but when it arrived and we put it in the space it was actually really overpowering so we had to shuffle some things around. Paul Izzard designed the seating for the poker table. We wanted some comfortable and relaxed booth seating that didn’t look too much like it was something out of a bar - we wanted something that looked like it was made for the space.”\r\n\r\nThe boys’ room opens out to the foyer, which underwent a dramatic makeover. “Originally the planters in here were all fountains, and there was the most overpowering smell of chlorine as soon as you walked in the door,” says Meiring. “They had lots of chrome fountain spikes, so it could actually be quite dangerous too if someone got drunk and fell in.” Various ideas were toyed with for the area, including a sculpture and a centralized meeting area, but in the end, Boyle spotted the two Mark (??) chairs in a catalogue. “I knew that they’d be the only two seats that would look really magnificent there.” The enormous Lolli e Memmoli chandelier came from ECC Lighting & Living. “I’d seen the chandeliers there so I went in and how much this one was. They gave me a price so I rang back the next day and said, ‘Yes, we want it,’ but they’d sold it that afternoon! So we had to go through the rigmarole of having one hand-made in Italy and waiting five or six months for it to be sent down.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"239\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n	\r\nFrom the foyer, a double staircase winds up to what used to be the dining room but has been transformed into a reading room. Mark had a big wooden bookcase that had been made by Apartmento, and this was really the only place for it, so he had a curved shelf made to match by cabinet-maker Ray Mark,” says Boyle. “There’s not a lot of natural wood in the house, so putting the Naguchi table in, which had a nice retro feel and nice curves, it created a softer feel. It’s probably the softest area in the house, and it’s got lovely light as well.” The soft feel is enhanced by the thick, deep green-black carpets that were hand knotted in India.  \r\n	\r\nThe upstairs balcony looks out over the pool, garden and barbecue areas, the only parts of the house that were essentially untouched, apart from the installation of lighting and sound systems. The garden design was done by Ted Smyth, who is really very well known,” says Herbst. “The rumour goes that they spent a million dollars on the landscaping when it was first built – and a million dollars was worth a bit more in those days!” Boyle adds. All the joinery around the windows and sliding doors to the balcony was replaced, and the outside of the house was replastered to give it a more modern look.\r\n	\r\n“The reason it has all worked is that we actually unhinged the house and put it back together,” says Herbst “The way the spaces interrelated, there was kind of an awkwardness about it, and it’s the connections between things that we’ve sorted out that has been the most successful.” And although the original house owed a debt more to Miami Vice than anything, these days it has a far sharper look. “It’s actually a modernist and a post-modern crossover. The balustrades and all kinds of elements in this building are actually quite [Richard] Meier-esque,” muses Herbst.','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words Melinda Williams<br />\nPhotography Carlo van de Roer<br />\nStyling Gabrielle Mirkin</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>Fast cars, big sunglasses and cocktails by the pool – this restored Auckland house captures the glamour of the 1980s with new millennium style.</strong></p>\n	<p>Everything was big in the ‘80s.

Just three little letters can instantly transport us into a world of blissful images of cool, calm spaces, soothing hot water, gentle chiming music, restorative treatments and relaxing massages.* \r\n\r\nThe idea of medicinal bathing has been around since Roman times, but fell out of favour in most cultures until the 16th century, when it was revived in England. Various theories exist as to where the term ‘spa’ arose from. The most common one runs that the name comes from the town of Spa in Belgium, long famed for the restorative quality of its mineral waters – not, originally, from soaking in them, but from drinking them, as the iron-bearing water had strengthening properties. Other sources suggest the word arose from the Latin spagere, meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten, or even that it is an acronym of the Latin phrase ‘sanitas per aquas’, or ‘health through water’.\r\n\r\nWhatever the original meaning, today the word ‘spa’ suggests a world of ways to indulge yourself while (ostensibly?) improving your health. And with the rise of luxury spa resorts around the globe, spas have also become complete design experiences as well. Modern spas draw influences from a wide range of styles and cultures, from traditional Turkish hammans, to natural landscapes and ultra-slick minimalist modernism. Here, we’ve drawn together some of the most stylish and luxurious spa resorts to retreat to when the stress of daily life is taking its toll. Whether your design taste runs to Asian-style zen or modern European geometrics, there’s a spa sure to soothe your sore eyes, as well as your sore muscles.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"241\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nTherme Vals, Switzerland			\r\n\"www.therme-vals.ch\":http://www.therme-vals.ch\r\nBeing the only thermal spring in Graubünden, the Therme Vals Spa, designed by architect Peter Zumthor is a stunning landmark built from 60,000 stone slabs of Valser Quarzite in different shades of grey. The combinations of light and shade, open and enclosed spaces and linear elements make for a highly sensuous and restorative experience. Below the pool deck is a wellness centre where you can have treatments focusing on relaxation and pampering.Located 1200m above sea level, dug deep into a mountain, Therme Vals is a masterpiece which has been declared a historic monument. Valser spring water (the ‘champagne’ of Swiss mineral water), fills six pools; a pool floating with rosehip petals, a fire pool (42˙C), an ice pool (14˙C), an indoor pool (32˙C), a panoramic outdoor pool and a pool that echoes with monastic chants.\r\n\r\nRoyal Malewane, South Africa		\r\n\"www.royalmalewane.com\":http://www.royalmalewane.com\r\nRoyal Malewane is internationally renowned as the pinnacle of luxury game viewing in Africa as well as being home to one of the most exclusive spas on the continent. Nestled in the heart of 13,000 hectares of wild African bush, this resort is the ultimate sanctury for the senses. Every aspect of the spa has been designed to encapsulate a true African spa experience, utilising the very best of eastern and western thinking. Stretching out between Jackelberry and Acacia Thorn, the bush spa’s clean lines and minimalist design exude an air of complete balance and tranquillity. Soothing colours, complemented by rich organic textures and open-plan design, create a mood of pure serenity.\r\nPositioned around the central courtyard are the beautifully appointed treatment rooms, fully equipped gymnasium, steam room, hot and cold African baths and bush casitas, perfect after a long day out on safari.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"242\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nHuvafen Fushi, Maldives\r\n\"www.huvafenfushi.com\":http://www.huvafenfushi.com\r\nHuvafen Fushi is a discreetly super-lux retreat located on its own lagoon on a tiny pristine island in North Malé Atoll. A naturalist’s wonderland where the stunning environment is an attraction in itself. The resort is made up of 43 naturally-modern bungalows and is exclusively home to the world’s first underwater spa. It’s where the Maldivian seascape merges fluidly with world class interior spa design. The colours and textures of the sea have provided the spa with all of the inspiration needed for its creation and makes a distinctive mark on the world spa scene with a combination of soothing architecture, cutting-edge spa technology and the very latest in water therapies. If celebrity patrons are an indicator of a hotel’s popularity, this resort is about as hot as it gets; Kate Moss, George Clooney, Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, have all visited.\r\n\r\nTschuggen, Switzerland\r\n\"www.tschuggen.ch/de\":http://www.tschuggen.ch/de\r\nA spectacular spa and wellness temple in the pristine mountain air of Arosa in the Swiss Alps. Famous architect and designer Mario Botta’s design is minimal with light and space being the key. Granite stone from the mountains, light maple wood and glass are the only three building materials used. With the open plan design, guests on the fourth floor can see right down to the ground floor. Water is in abundance, with springs throughout the site pouring pure Arosa spring water. Guests pass through a rain curtain into a small seated area where they can enjoy a programme of seasons – summer rain, a winter storm, fog, mist or pure sunshine, designed to soothe and invigorate the mind and soul. Natural stones throughout the knee-deep stream, passes through ice cold and hot spots, stimulating blood circulation and the nervous system. Tschuggen is a true oasis of health, beauty and wellbeing.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"243\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe Lalu, Taiwan\r\n\"www.thelalu.com.tw\":http://www.thelalu.com.tw\r\nThe Lalu overlooks tranquil waters of the mystical Sun Moon Lake and is surrounded by lush landscapes and natural wonders. Dating back to 1901, recent renovations and additions by Kerry Hill Architects have resurrected the resort to a new international level. At the Lalu guests can truly escape from society by hiding out in one of the seven private villas with individual swimming pools, courtyards and pavilions. The hotel’s spa comes with an extensive range of organic treatments using traditional Asian and specialty Western massages along with rejuvenating body scrubs, exclusive to The Lalu spa. Hot, warm and icy whirlpools, steam rooms, a dry Swedish sauna, 60-metre swimming pool, Japanese bathing and warming fireplaces overlook the spectacular Sun Moon Lake.\r\n\r\nLoisium, Austria\r\n\"www.loisiumhotel.at\":http://www.loisiumhotel.at\r\nThis striking aluminium clad hotel spa designed by noted American architect Stephen Holl (with the help of the local practice of Sam/Ott-Reinisch), is a wine-world center. Visitors are drawn to its spectacular look (inspired by the shape of a crumpled wine foil), and to its unique concept: a spa for wine lovers. Set amid newly erected vineyards, the 1000m2 spa has a selection of Vinotherapy treatments involving grape and wine products, with specific wine related treatments such as the Barrique Cuvee. The split level Aveda Destination Spa, decked out over three floors in pale green mosaic is Aveda’s first destination spa in the country of birth of its founder, Horst Rechelbacher. The 82-room hotel seems to float above air (built above a collection of 900 year old cellar passages), as a glass ground-floor complex including a rock pool and a larger swimming pool give way to a solid first and second floor.','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words Gabrielle Mirkin</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>If there’s one word guaranteed to produce a state of dreamlike longing in your average, hard-working person, it has to be ‘spa’.

The most common one runs that the name comes from the town of Spa in Belgium, long famed for the restorative quality of its mineral waters – not, originally, from soaking in them, but from drinking them, as the iron-bearing water had strengthening properties. Other sources suggest the word arose from the Latin spagere, meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten, or even that it is an acronym of the Latin phrase ‘sanitas per aquas’, or ‘health through water’.</p>\n	<p>Whatever the original meaning, today the word ‘spa’ suggests a world of ways to indulge yourself while (ostensibly?) improving your health. And with the rise of luxury spa resorts around the globe, spas have also become complete design experiences as well. Modern spas draw influences from a wide range of styles and cultures, from traditional Turkish hammans, to natural landscapes and ultra-slick minimalist modernism. Here, we’ve drawn together some of the most stylish and luxurious spa resorts to retreat to when the stress of daily life is taking its toll. Whether your design taste runs to Asian-style zen or modern European geometrics, there’s a spa sure to soothe your sore eyes, as well as your sore muscles.</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"241\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>Therme Vals, Switzerland<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.therme-vals.ch\">www.therme-vals.ch</a><br />\nBeing the only thermal spring in Graubünden, the Therme Vals Spa, designed by architect Peter Zumthor is a stunning landmark built from 60,000 stone slabs of Valser Quarzite in different shades of grey. The combinations of light and shade, open and enclosed spaces and linear elements make for a highly sensuous and restorative experience. Below the pool deck is a wellness centre where you can have treatments focusing on relaxation and pampering.Located 1200m above sea level, dug deep into a mountain, Therme Vals is a masterpiece which has been declared a historic monument. Valser spring water (the ‘champagne’ of Swiss mineral water), fills six pools; a pool floating with rosehip petals, a fire pool (42˙C), an ice pool (14˙C), an indoor pool (32˙C), a panoramic outdoor pool and a pool that echoes with monastic chants.</p>\n	<p>Royal Malewane, South Africa<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.royalmalewane.com\">www.royalmalewane.com</a><br />\nRoyal Malewane is internationally renowned as the pinnacle of luxury game viewing in Africa as well as being home to one of the most exclusive spas on the continent. Nestled in the heart of 13,000 hectares of wild African bush, this resort is the ultimate sanctury for the senses. Every aspect of the spa has been designed to encapsulate a true African spa experience, utilising the very best of eastern and western thinking. Stretching out between Jackelberry and Acacia Thorn, the bush spa’s clean lines and minimalist design exude an air of complete balance and tranquillity. Soothing colours, complemented by rich organic textures and open-plan design, create a mood of pure serenity.<br />\nPositioned around the central courtyard are the beautifully appointed treatment rooms, fully equipped gymnasium, steam room, hot and cold African baths and bush casitas, perfect after a long day out on safari.</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"242\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>Huvafen Fushi, Maldives<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.huvafenfushi.com\">www.huvafenfushi.com</a><br />\nHuvafen Fushi is a discreetly super-lux retreat located on its own lagoon on a tiny pristine island in North Malé Atoll. A naturalist’s wonderland where the stunning environment is an attraction in itself. The resort is made up of 43 naturally-modern bungalows and is exclusively home to the world’s first underwater spa. It’s where the Maldivian seascape merges fluidly with world class interior spa design. The colours and textures of the sea have provided the spa with all of the inspiration needed for its creation and makes a distinctive mark on the world spa scene with a combination of soothing architecture, cutting-edge spa technology and the very latest in water therapies. If celebrity patrons are an indicator of a hotel’s popularity, this resort is about as hot as it gets; Kate Moss, George Clooney, Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, have all visited.</p>\n	<p>Tschuggen, Switzerland<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.tschuggen.ch/de\">www.tschuggen.ch/de</a><br />\nA spectacular spa and wellness temple in the pristine mountain air of Arosa in the Swiss Alps. Famous architect and designer Mario Botta’s design is minimal with light and space being the key. Granite stone from the mountains, light maple wood and glass are the only three building materials used. With the open plan design, guests on the fourth floor can see right down to the ground floor. Water is in abundance, with springs throughout the site pouring pure Arosa spring water. Guests pass through a rain curtain into a small seated area where they can enjoy a programme of seasons – summer rain, a winter storm, fog, mist or pure sunshine, designed to soothe and invigorate the mind and soul. Natural stones throughout the knee-deep stream, passes through ice cold and hot spots, stimulating blood circulation and the nervous system. Tschuggen is a true oasis of health, beauty and wellbeing.</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"243\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>The Lalu, Taiwan<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.thelalu.com.tw\">www.thelalu.com.tw</a><br />\nThe Lalu overlooks tranquil waters of the mystical Sun Moon Lake and is surrounded by lush landscapes and natural wonders. Dating back to 1901, recent renovations and additions by Kerry Hill Architects have resurrected the resort to a new international level. At the Lalu guests can truly escape from society by hiding out in one of the seven private villas with individual swimming pools, courtyards and pavilions. The hotel’s spa comes with an extensive range of organic treatments using traditional Asian and specialty Western massages along with rejuvenating body scrubs, exclusive to The Lalu spa. Hot, warm and icy whirlpools, steam rooms, a dry Swedish sauna, 60-metre swimming pool, Japanese bathing and warming fireplaces overlook the spectacular Sun Moon Lake.</p>\n	<p>Loisium, Austria<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.loisiumhotel.at\">www.loisiumhotel.at</a><br />\nThis striking aluminium clad hotel spa designed by noted American architect Stephen Holl (with the help of the local practice of Sam/Ott-Reinisch), is a wine-world center. Visitors are drawn to its spectacular look (inspired by the shape of a crumpled wine foil), and to its unique concept: a spa for wine lovers. Set amid newly erected vineyards, the 1000m2 spa has a selection of Vinotherapy treatments involving grape and wine products, with specific wine related treatments such as the Barrique Cuvee. The split level Aveda Destination Spa, decked out over three floors in pale green mosaic is Aveda’s first destination spa in the country of birth of its founder, Horst Rechelbacher. The 82-room hotel seems to float above air (built above a collection of 900 year old cellar passages), as a glass ground-floor complex including a rock pool and a larger swimming pool give way to a solid first and second floor.</p>\n\n ','','\n\n ','/images/240.jpg','mag-article','issue37',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','spa-light-spa-bright','','','','','','','','','','','ce989d5ccb2fea9ecf9880340f1217d8','2007-03-12'),(127,'2007-03-12 14:11:00','gabrielle.mirkin','2007-05-28 06:46:25','gabrielle.mirkin','Urbis - Living in a Material World - Issue 37 on sale now!','','h5. !(imgright)/images/248.jpg (Urbis - Living in a Material World - Issue 37 on sale now!)!

The city itself is a masterpiece of urban design - the 19th century architect Baron Haussmann devised a series of wide leafy boulevards that criss-cross the city with the elegance and precision of the couturier’s shears. These create the arrondisements where the elegant Parisians live, work and munch nonchalantly on baguettes and croissants. Little wonder then that this city is also home to one of the world’s most important design events. \r\n\r\nMaison et Objet has in recent years become Europe’s premiere appointment for the home decorating industry. Focussing on interior detailing rather than simply furniture, twice a year Maison et Objet tempts exhibitors and visitors alike to rush to the City of Light. With more than 80,000 visitors attending this year’s January edition and over 3200 international brands on show, Maison et Objet is one trade event that serious design cognoscenti cannot afford to miss.\r\n\r\nWhile some would undoubtedly rather pass their Parisian sojourn rifling through the racks at Colette or shopping for delicacies at Fauchon, Maison et Objet is worth a visit. Far from your average trade show, the fair is composed of five separate but linked design events: Maison et Objet, Planete Meuble, Now – Design à Vivre, Scènes d’intérieur and Maison et Objet èditeurs. Each focuses on a different aspect within the design and furnishing industry, each highlighting the new trends from the international design avant garde.\r\n\r\nAmong the designers honoured this year was the relentlessly chic local lad Christian Lacroix, whose flamboyant savoir faire is no longer limited merely to frocks and rocks thanks to a recent commission from the French railways to design interiors of the latest fleet of TGV trains. Rosita Missoni, the grande dame of the Italian fashion house famous for its extravagant knits was also singled out for mention this season. Missoni’s collaboration with TJ Vestor in the creation of the Missoni Home collection yielded strangely alluring fruits this season, with the maison’s signature stripes and colours taking centre stage. \r\n\r\nThe more directional, design-led part of Maison et Objet, ‘Now – Design à Vivre’ chose to throw the spotlight on German designer Konstantin Grcic. Grcic, who has a truckload of covetable collaborations under his belt (working with Magis, Agape, Driade, Moroso and Muji, to name but a few) has in recent years led the way with his provocative and angular signature style, and will be the subject of a monographic exhibition to be held later this year at Paris’ Museum of Decorative Arts. So, among the endless accolades and champagne soaked soirées… what were the trends on show at this year’s event?\r\n\r\nLuxury: Loro Piana left behind the catwalks of Milan to première a collection of accessories for the home in cashmere, angora, silk and shantung in muted, earthy tones. Throws, upholstery fabrics carpets and accessories quietly screamed opulence and good taste. \r\n\r\nNostalgia and a suitably Proustian ‘remembrance of things past’ were evident in the continued trend for the neo-romantic and neo-classical. Eminent wallpaper producers Watts of Westminster mined their archives, pulling out 19th century designs and updating them in new colours. Heavy rococo brocades were revisited in new colours in the upholstery collections presented by Etamine and Casamance – a charming historical irreverence drawing inspiration from Coppola’s Marie Antoinette. The trend for floral motifs looks set to stick around for another season: this year oversized irises and maple leaves take the place of last season’s fussy liberty prints. \r\n	\r\nBritish mainstay Habitat chose Maison et Objet to present its spring summer collection, characterised by a strident palate of colours - magenta, cyan, and chartreuse. This theme was picked up by other exhibitors such as lighting company R’Pure, who presented their cheeky ‘fifty/fifty’ lamp in a wide range of ‘pop’ tones.  \r\n	\r\nSoft, organic forms are on the rise in the lighting industry with curvaceous pieces unveiled by Obue and French design house Cinna Roset. Of particular note the glass ‘Meteorite’ lamps by Vanessa Mitriani, intriguing small-scale pieces with a distinctive aluminium ‘crust’. And the work of Israeli designer Arik Levy for Baccarat was particularly beautiful; a collection of vases, goblets and glasses breathing new life into crystal, whilst maintaining a respect for the past. \r\n	\r\nThe famous French revolutionary spirit continues to leave the home design industry unscathed. Past season’s trends were honed and developed, details were fine-tuned, but the substance remained the same. In a country renowned for its good taste; the nation which gave the world the word ‘chic’ - it is not surprising that Maison et Objet delivers ample doses of both. Garçon!

Since then, he has built up a dedicated following, including clients who commission him to find specific pieces for their homes. \r\n	\r\n“I’ve got a double dose of the ‘chair gene’, or so my parents often say!” he laughs. As a youngster, James spent many summer holidays being hauled from antique store to garage sale as his parents hunted for bentwood and spindleback chairs for their collections. As an adult, James also has a passion for designer chairs, but his interests extend well beyond, to the art, fashion, textiles, architecture, ceramics and even cars of the mid-20th century. “The ‘50s and ‘60s were great times for young people looking to expand their horizons,” he says. “It’s a nostalgic, even romantic connection I feel with that relaxed and irrepressible freedom, and exuberant optimism for the future.”\r\n	\r\nJames’ particular taste is for mid-century modern Scandinavian-style furniture, commonly referred to as Danish Modern. “It’s the combination of sculptural aesthetic qualities – clean lines and elegant, organic forms – with no-nonsense functionality.” He is charmed by the way the designers aimed to beautify the most mundane of products: “for example Catherine Holm’s range of Lotus enamelware, Jens Quistgaard’s teak and metalware, and stainless steel cutlery and kitchenware by Dansk and Arne Jacobsen.”  \r\n	\r\nHis TradeMe listings tend towards New Zealand-made Scandinavian-style furniture by companies like Danske Mobler, Airest, Jon Jansen, J.W. Backhouse, Don Furniture, as well as the Australian Fler and Parker Furniture than the big international names, though he has had recent listings from Eero Aarnio, Knoll and Kartell. His choice is partly practical but largely personal preference. “I tend to steer clear of star names – Eames, Arne Jacobsen, and George Nelson – and concentrate instead on the homegrown proponents of modern art, interior and furniture design who championed the laesthetic trends in 1950s, ‘60s and ‘70s New Zealand.” \r\n	\r\nAlthough he’s learned never to say never when it comes to selling his private collection, he says he would find it hard to part with his \r\nset of four Ernest Race ‘Antelope’ chairs designed for the Festival of Britain in 1951, an Eames lounge chair and ottoman, his John Crichton tile mosaic chargers, Jon Jansen mosaic tile coffee table, or his limited edition Susan Skerman print for the 1970 Osaka Exhibition.

Chanel Resort 2008 Collection\r\n\r\n!(imgleft)/images/274.jpg (Chanel Resort 2008 Collection)! Karl Lagerfeld and Chanel launched the 2008 Chanel Cruise Collection last Friday at Santa Monica Airport, Los Angeles. The scene was designed like an exclusive airport lounge complete with three cocktail bars, personalized flight bags on every seat, and arrival and departure screens listing \"Chanel Line\" flights. A mix of satin, stripes, sequins, tweed and denim gave way to a utilitarian and feminine collection. Silhouettes were flowing and light and ready to take flight. There was either a lot of leg via mini skirts or a long strong female form via wide-legged pants. All of this with layered chains and pearls, peep-toe boots and ultra-cool Chanel gloves will surely keep the jet set happy.\r\n>>Visit \"www.chanel.com\":http://www.chanel.com\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nh4.

In fact, we love Paris at any old time of the year. What’s not to love about this magnificent city where history is so elaborately monumentalised at every turn? The glamour of a daytime walk along the Seine admiring the architecture of the Louvre is matched only by the beauty of the Eiffel Tower in the evening, as it sparkles like an enormous Christmas tree for the first hour of its nightly lighting. For the modernist design lover, however, the neo-classical boulevards of Paris may not seem like the first place to uncover mid- to late-last century gems.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"284\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nAnyone who has seen the Pompidou Centre, conceived by then-President Georges Pompidou who wanted to create a cultural institution for modern art in the heart of Paris, can understand why, in 1977, it shocked Paris’ traditionalists to the core. Through the 1980s, increasingly modern buildings began to appear in Paris, including the Grand Arch skyscraper in the Defense area, and culminating in IM Pei’s Pyramide, soaring through the centre of the palatial Renaissance architecture of the Louvre. More is yet to come, with spectacularly modern buildings by Frank Gehry and Thom Mayne planned for construction in the city over the next few years.\r\n\r\nFor years, wealthy Brits and, increasingly, Americans have made pilgrimages to Paris to spend up large on the sought-after and readily accessible French antiques on offer in the cobbled streets of the St Germain district. But among the 19th century architecture, Louis XIV antiques and super-modern skyscrapers, Paris also increasingly offers hidden gems of mid-century furniture stores, design hotels and bars and restaurants by the world’s best contemporary designers.\r\n\r\nWhere to Stay:\r\nHôtel Montelambert, 3 Rue de Montelambert. (7th)\r\nPerfectly located in the heart of the St Germain, this hotel is directly across the street from famous French designer Christian Liaigre’s furniture showroom, and right next door to the highly celebrated, very popular and eye-wateringly expensive restaurant Joel Roubechon.

The Petit Moulin is a whimsical hotel, offering an almost haute couture dress-up-box feel, created by Christian Lacroix.

(7th)\r\nAs implied earlier, this place requires a large expense account. It is, however, truly worth it. The restaurant offers the most inventive of meodern French cuisine with sit-at-the-bar Japanese-style dining.

(16th)\r\nIf you haven’t had your fill of Philippe Starck, a visit to Baccarat’s Cristal Dining Room should fix you. Once again Starck goes overboard and creates a magical dining environment, using Baccarat crystals to full effect, in combination with sumptuous satin walls. If you’re serious about dinner here, or perhaps looking to propose to someone and want the most elaborate and glamorous environment imaginable, book the Salon Rose, but be warned, you’ll need to do it months in advance. \r\n\r\nCafé Baci, 36 Rue du Turenne. (1st)\r\nA great place to stop for breakfast, lunch, dinner or cocktails. Because it’s owned by famous French actor Jean-Pierre Bacri, it attracts a hip local French crowd; a relief after the Americanisation of many other restaurants.\r\n\r\nB4 Restaurant , 8 Square Saint Croix, (2nd). \r\nAfter a hard morning of scouring the streets of the Marais for mid-century design classics, stop by the extremely hip B4 for a quick bite in a modern restaurant, the style of which is rare but refreshing in \r\nthese parts.\r\n\r\nWhat to See and Do:\r\nChristian Liaigre, 42 Rue du Bac. (7th)\r\nNo design-lover’s trip to Paris should exclude a visit to Liaigre’s store. Made famous by his numerous interiors projects around the globe, including the exceptional Mercer Hotel in New York, the store showcases and sells many of the pieces Liaigre designed for his famous commissions.\r\n\r\nJousse Enterprise, 18 Rue de Seine (7th)\r\nThe Jousse Enterprise is a paradise for mid-century furniture lovers and art collectors alike, holding regular exhibitions by local and international artists alongside their ever-changing assortment of Eames, and Corbusier classics. An exhibition of Thomas Grünfeld’s wild taxidermy amused us when we visited. \r\n\r\nFiesta Galerie, 45 Rue Vieille du Temple (7th)\r\nThis gem in the Marais is the perfect place to pick up that long searched-for mid-century piece to take pride of place back home.

And for those of us without the budget for their hefty price tags, at least we can enjoy the ingenuity of their hilarious window displays.\r\n\r\nInstitut du Monde Arabe, 1 Rue des Fosses, St Bernard.  (5th)\r\nOur favourite French architect, Jean Nouvel, cannot go without mention. This incredibly beautiful building offers an Arabic feel from afar, but closer up, you realize each patterned window is a mechanical iris that opens and closes automatically in response to the brightness of the day. A genius way to protect the Middle Eastern antiques and artifacts within.\r\n\r\nMaison de Verre, 31 Rue Saint Guillaume (7th)\r\nArchitects Pierre Chareau and Bernard Bijvoet have created a truly modern architectural marvel in the heart of St Germain.

Her bedroom, kitchen and dining room are as luminous and minimalist as the living room is jet-black and decadent. “It’s Modern in style, which for me equates with light,” says the partner at San Francisco and London-based architects KallosTurin. “And to contrast the brightness, I turned the focus in the lounge on dark and mysterious.” \r\n\r\nMost people would be sceptical about painting a living space wholly in black, for fear of it looking too austere. Yet for Turin, who deals with the issues of form and colour on a daily basis, the choices, however inspired, were clear. She matched swatches taken from Le Corbusier’s ‘Colour Keyboards,’ a colour scheme developed between 1931 and 1959 for Swiss wallpaper company Salubra and published in ‘Le Corbusier - Polychromie Architecturale’. Describing the shade of black that forms the sultry backdrop as containing “subtle hints of aubergine and carbon-brown,” she goes on to explain: “Pure black on the walls would be rather oppressive. It’s generally perceived as a tricky colour, but depending on how matte or reflective the finish, black surfaces can generate a tactile and calming feel to a room.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"279\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nTurin teamed up with Stephania Kallos to form KallosTurin in 2001, after working together at the London practice of David Chipperfield. The pair specialise in trans-Atlantic residential, retail and restaurant projects that weave their calm, almost monastic, approach with an edge of flamboyance. When starting up the practice back in her hometown of San Francisco, Turin’s initial search with husband Jonathan Gans for their first home together was targeted towards “anything in a Modernist style with a view. But this has neither!” she laughs. Instead, it was an Italianate bungalow built in the 1920s that won the pair over on account of its “good bones and generous proportions being really quite beautiful.” The house’s location in the prosperous neighbourhood of Pacific Heights, situated on the scenic hilltop crest not far from the city centre, only added to the draw. \r\n\r\nYet despite the fact that a total of seven renovations had been carried out over as many decades, from \'70s mouldings to \'80s frosted glass, the essential three-level layout of the home was in need of only a little reconfiguration. \"Thankfully the place hadn\'t suffered the usual carving up of rooms you often find in old houses,\" she says. \"It hadn\'t lost its sense of grace.\" Turin retained the oak floors and the leaded windows downstairs, where \"the details felt authentic,\" while most of the changes, albeit minor, were made upstairs. By stripping back the carved cornices around the ceilings and removing archways from the corridors, the handiwork achieved the clean lines she wanted.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"281\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe result brings a sophisticated yet relaxingly easy feel to the place that features Turin\'s carefully tempered contrasts. In the entrance, smooth jet-stained floors offset alabaster walls, where Turin likes to shift her artwork about like a gallery. A little further along the hall to the right, the original 1920s fireplace and leaded windows set against the darkness render the living room like an installation. They could have felt out of place in the modern context of mid-20th century design classics and Italian contemporary furniture, from the B&B Italia sofas in softest ecru linen and Minotti metallic cube tables to Marcel Wanders\' super-sized lamp, but don\'t.\r\n\r\nThe look of the house clearly registers as dark and mysterious, but like everything else inside, there’s an innovative approach to the detailing. The monochrome scheme is carried through to the kitchen and breakfast area that gives way onto the south-facing garden through the original French doors. The pure-white walls add to the brightness of the space. Turin designed a stretch of a white leather-upholstered integral banquette that doubles as storage and kept the original cupboard doors, painting them white in contrast to the basalt stone bench tops. From the kitchen, there’s a loop around to the more formal affair of the dining room that glints with Swarovski crystal chandeliers. \r\n\r\nThere was a small fifth bedroom downstairs that has been transformed into a cellar for Gan’s extensive wine collection. Turin designed the bar in redwood to match ready-made storage units, and installed climate control and practical gravel on the floor that brings an authentic feel to the space. Against the black backdrop, the warm glow from the delicate ‘Wednesday’ lights, designed by Tord Boontje, adds to the perfect environment.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"282\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nTurin’s subtle mixing of shades of white brings an ethereal effect to the bedroom she describes as ‘pearlescent’. “I love the way the old silver-dollar eucalyptus has wrapped its limbs around the side of the house.

It’s as if the place happens to you in moments,” she muses. Sometimes it pays to trust your instincts.\r\n','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p>_Words Danielle Miller <br />\nPhotography Richard Powers _</p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>With confidence and careful accessorising, monochromes make a striking Canvas for this house.</strong> </p>\n	<p>According to Abigail Turin, the distinctive monochrome scheme in her home wasn’t fashioned around plain black and white. Her bedroom, kitchen and dining room are as luminous and minimalist as the living room is jet-black and decadent. “It’s Modern in style, which for me equates with light,” says the partner at San Francisco and London-based architects KallosTurin. “And to contrast the brightness, I turned the focus in the lounge on dark and mysterious.” </p>\n	<p>Most people would be sceptical about painting a living space wholly in black, for fear of it looking too austere. Yet for Turin, who deals with the issues of form and colour on a daily basis, the choices, however inspired, were clear. She matched swatches taken from Le Corbusier’s ‘Colour Keyboards,’ a colour scheme developed between 1931 and 1959 for Swiss wallpaper company Salubra and published in ‘Le Corbusier &#8211; Polychromie Architecturale’. Describing the shade of black that forms the sultry backdrop as containing “subtle hints of aubergine and carbon-brown,” she goes on to explain: “Pure black on the walls would be rather oppressive. It’s generally perceived as a tricky colour, but depending on how matte or reflective the finish, black surfaces can generate a tactile and calming feel to a room.”</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"279\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>Turin teamed up with Stephania Kallos to form KallosTurin in 2001, after working together at the London practice of David Chipperfield. The pair specialise in trans-Atlantic residential, retail and restaurant projects that weave their calm, almost monastic, approach with an edge of flamboyance. When starting up the practice back in her hometown of San Francisco, Turin’s initial search with husband Jonathan Gans for their first home together was targeted towards “anything in a Modernist style with a view. But this has neither!” she laughs. Instead, it was an Italianate bungalow built in the 1920s that won the pair over on account of its “good bones and generous proportions being really quite beautiful.” The house’s location in the prosperous neighbourhood of Pacific Heights, situated on the scenic hilltop crest not far from the city centre, only added to the draw. </p>\n	<p>Yet despite the fact that a total of seven renovations had been carried out over as many decades, from &#8216;70s mouldings to &#8216;80s frosted glass, the essential three-level layout of the home was in need of only a little reconfiguration. &#8220;Thankfully the place hadn&#8217;t suffered the usual carving up of rooms you often find in old houses,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It hadn&#8217;t lost its sense of grace.&#8221; Turin retained the oak floors and the leaded windows downstairs, where &#8220;the details felt authentic,&#8221; while most of the changes, albeit minor, were made upstairs. By stripping back the carved cornices around the ceilings and removing archways from the corridors, the handiwork achieved the clean lines she wanted.</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"281\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>The result brings a sophisticated yet relaxingly easy feel to the place that features Turin&#8217;s carefully tempered contrasts. In the entrance, smooth jet-stained floors offset alabaster walls, where Turin likes to shift her artwork about like a gallery. A little further along the hall to the right, the original 1920s fireplace and leaded windows set against the darkness render the living room like an installation. They could have felt out of place in the modern context of mid-20th century design classics and Italian contemporary furniture, from the B&#38;B Italia sofas in softest ecru linen and Minotti metallic cube tables to Marcel Wanders&#8217; super-sized lamp, but don&#8217;t.</p>\n	<p>The look of the house clearly registers as dark and mysterious, but like everything else inside, there’s an innovative approach to the detailing. The monochrome scheme is carried through to the kitchen and breakfast area that gives way onto the south-facing garden through the original French doors. The pure-white walls add to the brightness of the space. Turin designed a stretch of a white leather-upholstered integral banquette that doubles as storage and kept the original cupboard doors, painting them white in contrast to the basalt stone bench tops. From the kitchen, there’s a loop around to the more formal affair of the dining room that glints with Swarovski crystal chandeliers. </p>\n	<p>There was a small fifth bedroom downstairs that has been transformed into a cellar for Gan’s extensive wine collection. Turin designed the bar in redwood to match ready-made storage units, and installed climate control and practical gravel on the floor that brings an authentic feel to the space. Against the black backdrop, the warm glow from the delicate ‘Wednesday’ lights, designed by Tord Boontje, adds to the perfect environment.</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"282\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>Turin’s subtle mixing of shades of white brings an ethereal effect to the bedroom she describes as ‘pearlescent’. “I love the way the old silver-dollar eucalyptus has wrapped its limbs around the side of the house. It makes the most beautiful flickering light patterns here.” By virtue of her sense of the Modern aesthetic, her redecoration of the house has an additional touch of alchemy that has transformed the place into one that manifests personal harmony. “There’s a magical quality of light that didn’t filter through before. It’s as if the place happens to you in moments,” she muses.

He was runner-up in the Metro/Canon Young Photographer’s Award in 2005 and since then has been exhibiting his photographs of classic modernist architecture. Strankowski’s passion is photography, he says. “Through photography I discovered an affinity for the geometrically simple forms and proportions of modernist architecture.” He adds, “I love the idea of modernism. As a design philosophy modernism is incredibly powerful.” \r\n\r\nDescribed by gallerist Tim Melville as a “sophisticated and clean brand of modernism,” Strankowski’s work treads delicately between homage and all-out worship of modernist ideals, both photographic and architectural. Putting aside the question, ‘At which point did modernism develop into a series of brands?’ his works instill quiet reverence into even a hardened soul. The pull towards abstraction in his images provides a respite from the oversaturated world of advertising messages and photographic commodification. The photographs are printed quite large, and invoke a transcendental stillness and calmness, like a glassy swimming pool on a tranquil day. \r\n\r\nHis first exhibition in Auckland, Monument, was a photographic essay of modernist architectural details from familiar Auckland buildings. Carefully isolating details of local sites, Strankowski created a subtle slice of utopia at home. Strankowski says, “What motivated Monument was a desire to magnify or bring into view these little gems that we have.” His exhibition Villa at the former G2 gallery (now Tim Melville Gallery) in March this year went further afield to France.\r\n\r\nVilla was a meditation on Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye, at Poissy near Paris. The generic title is a device used by Strankowski to isolate the work outside of time and place. To call the show Savoye would have been too particular, to place the work in a very real space and time. Instead he says, it is “important for me to place these forms outside time and location. I want to isolate structure and remove associations with current context.” Strankowski adds, “I am not so interested in the decay of the buildings; I am more interested in their timelessness.” \r\nStrankowski studied sculpture and this affinity with three-dimensional space informs his work. “I love form and light and 3D spaces,” he says. Talking about his March exhibition Villa, Strankowski says, “What motivated the softness of these shots was the whole idea of looking through a slightly dirty window. The detail is important to a certain extent, but having it slightly out of focus jars your consciousness into thinking maybe this is not real, maybe this is a memory or a reminiscence of something… it pushes the work out of documentation, and into communicating an idea.”\r\n\r\nThe preoccupation with timelessness takes a leap forward with his exhibition Futuropolis which examines in close-up and svelte detail the work of Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. With an almost science-fiction aesthetic the Futuropolis works share a heady sense of power and utopian achievement with Strankowski’s commissioned works of Auckland’s commercial buildings. The Futuropolis works premiered at Nuzi Gallery in Shanghai earlier this year, the images in Urbis are the first time the images have been shown in New Zealand.

In this quiet area, many iconic residential buildings by Joseph Eichler, the king of West Coast Modernism, rest comfortably in the Californian sun, capturing in architecture the spirit of ‘Californian Dreamin’.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"314\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n“When I was a child, my perception of America came from all those ‘50s TV shows. Now I feel like I have stepped into that world – for me it’s the ultimate in Californian living,” says In’t Hout, who grew up in Holland. Sainato, a native to America, and In’t Hout met in Germany while they were both working for multi-chain clothing brand Esprit. When Sainato decided to move back to America the pair had to resort to letter writing and phone calls. It didn’t take long for love (and a few expensive phone bills) to draw In’t Hout to the States. In their Eichler house, Sainato, now a successful art director in California, and In’t Hout, who runs her own children’s wear company, Extra Small, have found the perfect backdrop to display their 20th century tastes.\r\n\r\n“It’s like walking back in time,” says Sainato. For the couple, buying an Eichler home was not just about purchasing a shell for them to live in – they were buying into the history of it. “The longer we live here, the more we want to find out about it and the more we appreciate it.”\r\n\r\nThis historic yet understated suburban house played an important part in American history. Eichler chose to use the building, as his display house, showing San Francisco families an optimistic, middle-class, mid-century vision of the good life with its easy indoor–outdoor flow, oversized garden, open-plan living and modern, cheap materials.\r\n\r\nToday, Sainato and In’t Hout’s home, with its mahogany walls, floor-to-ceiling windows and spring-fresh décor, gloriously celebrates bringing the outside in. When walking into the house from the street visitors walk straight into a glass atrium bathed in light, with a view of the whole house and the backyard beyond. “It really did feel like a time warp the first time we walked in,” says In’t Hout. “[Eichler’s houses] are very simple, modern design homes, filled with natural daylight giving off an amazing energy. In the winter, with the fireplace burning and the pouring rain hitting the windows in the atrium, it’s really cosy.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"316\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nBefore owning this light-filled oasis the couple’s last home was dark, damp and had no garden. “We rented our last home for 10 years,” says Sainato. “It was situated in the Knoll Valley forest so we got hardly any light into the house. The neighborhood we lived in was nice and we made a lot of great friends in the area but we outgrew it. Iris wanted to start her own company and work from home so it was time to find a new home that we owned.”\r\n\r\nEven while living in their previous home Sainato and In’t Hout were passionate collectors of 20th century design. The pair has long enjoyed trawling flea markets and second-hand shops for vintage design. “When the furniture removalists moved our furniture into our new home they thought we had bought their furniture purposefully for this house. They placed the furniture without any guidance and it’s pretty much where we have it now,” laughs Sainato.\r\n \r\nWhile searching for their new home, Sainato and In’t Hout often dreamed of finding a home by Eichler but his designs come on the market infrequently, and even then have often suffered an aesthetic battering over the years. “It took some time for us to save and find our dream home – the nostalgic houses are not cheap and are hard to find. We spent our weekends over two years looking for one. We couldn’t believe our luck with this house being so untouched,” recounts Sainato. In fact, the house was in such good condition that the couple’s only undertaking was to replace the peeling beige linoleum floor with a similar vinyl tile, choosing a speckled white to counterbalance the abundance of dark mahogany used through the house.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"317\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe ‘50s dream home is much like a glass box, flowing easily from the large open plan living and dining through to the master bedroom. The second bedroom has been turned into a his-and-hers office. “It’s wonderful sitting at my desk, looking out into the atrium and having the light pour in. I love the open-air lifestyle… perhaps due to my upbringing in Holland,” says In’t Hout. \r\nThroughout the the house the creative pair have added vivid splashes of colour. Blue, green and orange pop out and add a fun charm to the home. “We are both creative and love colour,” explains Sainato. “It’s important to have colour in the house with the mahogany and glass walls because the space could feel dull otherwise.”\r\n \r\nPeople lucky enough to have been raised in California could easily overlook Eichler houses, or take them for granted. But people like Sainato and In’t Hout are smart enough to recognize them as the iconic designs they are. “It felt right the minute we walked into this house and we knew,  ‘This is where we belong.’ It has brought along really great people who have educated us about the space. I tell people we are caretakers. It’s a real find to get something that is still in its original state and is well maintained. It’s like we have been handed the responsibility to keep it the way we found it,” enthuses Sainato. Here at Urbis, we think they’re doing a great job so far.','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words and styling Amanda Talbot <br />\nPhotography Richard Powers</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>Once a model of 1950s suburban bliss, Joseph Eichler houses are  now sought  after as the height of modern California cool.</strong> </p>\n	<p>When driving along the suburban streets of San Rafael, San Francisco, where Iris In’t Hout and Michael Sainato live, house after house calls to mind the idyllic era portrayed in the 1950s television shows so many of us grew up with.

When it came to his new family home in Sydney’s Woollahra, he knew he wanted a showcase property that would reflect his aesthetic sensibility, while at the same time providing a functional and welcoming family home. Enter New Zealand-born, Sydney/Noosa-based architect Ian Moore, whom the Fink family had worked with before. “They asked me to have a look at the house before they signed on the dotted line, and asked me; ‘Can you make this work’?” recalls Moore. “And I said, ‘I think so,’ crossing my fingers!”\r\n\r\nThere was a lot to ‘make work’. As Moore explains, the primary challenge was to take the 1840s sandstone cottage – “an unusual home, with heritage issues associated with the front” – and convert what had previously been a two-bedroom cottage with an ‘80s renovation, into a contemporary three-bedroom, two-bathroom residence to house Fink and his wife, their three young children and two dogs. “We had to somehow get an extra, significantly sized bedroom and ensuite somewhere onto the piece of land… and that was hard,” admits Moore. Yet his solution, when it came, was nothing short of inspired.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"318\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nNestled between two popular retail outlets on a busy street in Woollahra, the quaint façade of the building possesses all the charm one might expect of a cottage its age. But open the door, and what lies inside is, in the architect’s words, “a completely secret and unexpected interior.” From the doorway, the eye is drawn through the entire home, right through to the back of the garage. The overriding effect is one of stark white space, dotted with splashes of vivid colour, and a seemingly endless line of vision. Fink wanted the clean, precise, ordered feel of his Hugo Boss stores recreated in his home – indeed, the couch in the lounge and the outdoor set were purchased from the company in Germany that fits out his stores.\r\n\r\n“It was all about dealing with relatively small spaces but using the central courtyard to allow everything to feel much more generous, and also maintain a sense of privacy,” Moore explains. “It was one of those standard exercises of taking a very small inner-city house and trying to make it not only physically bigger but make it visually feel much, much larger than it really is.” Externally, in keeping with heritage guidelines, the front of the cottage was faithfully restored. Inside, however, the only sign of the home’s ‘true identity’ is the front door. Everything else is preternaturally slick and of-the-moment. Like a hidden treasure, the entire sandstone cottage remains, completely intact, beneath the plaster of the modern renovation. \r\n\r\nIn the front room, the sandstone wall was lined. A column was removed and the lowered ceiling pushed up. A plasma TV and almost invisible Ecosmart ethanol-fuelled fireplace now sit underneath an abundance of storage cupboards – the first of many such cupboards hidden away within the house. Fatboys (which the dogs enjoy lounging on), a hairy ottoman and an Eames chaise lounge complete the picture.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"320\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nNow, the spacious kitchen operates as a family room, with direct connection to the stunning courtyard and, in a clever extrapolation of the living space, beyond to the garage. A Smeg cooktop sets up the language of a deep, chunky, high gloss white Hi-Macs resin benchtop. To the extreme left is an integrated fridge; to the right, a pantry. The benchtop is repeated in the island, again in all-white resin (even the sinks), which has a ‘fading away’ effect, again maximising the sense of space.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this stylish minimalism, there are some impressive focal points of décor. Owners Eric and Jackie first found the kauri dining table “covered in black grease” – it had been an old Telecom worker’s bench. Scrubbed up, it now sits in splendid juxtaposition against the Philippe Starck Louis Ghost chairs and a French chandelier dating from the 1820s that Eric appropriated from his father’s antique shop. A striking Adelta Bubble Chair fills a corner of the room specifically designed to accommodate it. From this expansive kitchen, you can see through to the courtyard. “We re-did the landscaping and built in a concrete bench. Eventually the creeper will grow over, and become a ‘green wall’,” says Moore.\r\n\r\nIt is from the courtyard, perhaps, that one can best appreciate the most stunning and innovative aspect of the house – its ‘bridge’. This extraordinary metal-and-glass span is Moore’s visionary solution to the ‘extra bedroom and bathroom’ issue. As he laughingly admits: “There aren’t too many houses in Paddington or Woollahra with a bridge across their courtyard!” Unwilling to lose any of the usable space downstairs, Moore knocked off the top of the garage to create a parent’s retreat and ensuite. The plan did not go off without any hitches – the council intervened, with the result being a slightly oddly shaped Dutch gable in the roof.\r\n \r\nThe bridge provides some shade from the sun and gives a sense of enclosure to the dining area, as well as providing natural light and ventilation, and a sense of privacy. “There is a degree of separation for the parents, but at the same time a direct link – and it’s a bit of fun for the kids to run across!” says Moore. What do the owners think of this bold addition? “It is one of my favourite features,” smiles Jackie Fink. “I love the play of light. The children call it the Harbour Bridge.” In keeping with the attention to detail throughout the house, Moore installed stainless steel mesh and lighting to the underside of the bridge: “It gives a little sparkle; the light does interesting things.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"321\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe upstairs section of the house mirrors the mood downstairs, with vast expanses of white space, plenty of light, and design features to maximise the use of space. An example is the boys’ bedroom, which has a sliding wall rather than simply a door, allowing a flexible arrangement. Directly outside it sits a ‘gathering place’ in the corridor. A single long white resin benchtop provides a common area and link between the bedrooms – this family study provides a space where the children can do their homework in years to come.\r\n\r\nThe Fink’s showpiece house is stark, without being cold. “The owners wanted it to be clinical but still have warmth,” explains Moore. To that end, wide Vistorian Ash floorboards run throughout. As well, favourite artworks hang on walls adding splashes of colour and a glimpse into the inhabitants’ personalities. “The quirky furniture and art and use of pink offsets the space,” offers Moore. “They’re the ideal clients; there were no disappointments. Whatever they do seems to be right. We were in sync from day one.”\r\n\r\nStyle, vision and detail intersect at every juncture in this impressive renovation. From the Belgian Kreon light fittings to the airy breezeways and exact positioning of the louvres, nothing has been overlooked. The proof, as always, is in the living. So how does it feel to live here? The Finks smile when the question is posed. “It’s joyous,” says Jackie softly. But the last word ought to be given to the master of understatement, Moore: “It’s not a big one. But it’s a nice one.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words Rowena Mary <br />\nPhotography Brett Boardman</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>An owner’s fashionable eye for design helped turn this tiny heritage cottage into an utterly contemporary family home.</strong></p>\n	<p>It’s safe to assume that, as the owner of several Hugo Boss franchises, Eric Fink knows a thing or two about style.

As well, favourite artworks hang on walls adding splashes of colour and a glimpse into the inhabitants’ personalities. “The quirky furniture and art and use of pink offsets the space,” offers Moore. “They’re the ideal clients; there were no disappointments. Whatever they do seems to be right. We were in sync from day one.”</p>\n	<p>Style, vision and detail intersect at every juncture in this impressive renovation. From the Belgian Kreon light fittings to the airy breezeways and exact positioning of the louvres, nothing has been overlooked. The proof, as always, is in the living. So how does it feel to live here? The Finks smile when the question is posed. “It’s joyous,” says Jackie softly. But the last word ought to be given to the master of understatement, Moore: “It’s not a big one. But it’s a nice one.”</p>\n\n\n ','','\n\n ','/images/319.jpg','mag-article','issue39',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','fashion-house','','','','','','','','','','','0ef4d155005eff1a5930da2568a7a254','2007-07-26'),(230,'2008-03-07 06:11:50','gabrielle.mirkin','2008-03-07 06:23:23','gabrielle.mirkin','Auckland International Buskers Festival','','The hottest busking acts from around the world set Auckland’s street on fire each summer.

But rarely, if ever, is an architectural story so simple. In this case, that of a monumental home in concrete first built in 1973, this is the house that Ron and Phil and Jeff and Tim, and many, many others over the house’s 34-year history, built. Through at least four sets of owners and as many serious alterations, renovations and restorations, the living spaces have been moved in and out, expanded and filled in, stripped and restored. And, after all this, from tinkering to full-scale gutting, this year the house was declared the winner of New Zealand’s Supreme architectural award by the New Zealand Institute of Architects.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"350\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nIt was destined to be an unusual and significant project right from the start. Architect Ron Sang was commissioned by the property’s first owner, Phil Sargent, to create a house using concrete as the primary material. Sargent, who headed a construction company, planned to use his own company to construct the house, and was keen to use what was then mainly an industrial material. “The fact that we were building in concrete meant that we were able to do these very large cantilevered balconies,” remembers Sang. “But also because it was concrete, we had to make it interesting.”\r\n\r\nSang was partly inspired in his design for the three-storey house by the Sydney home of the late Australian architect Harry Seidler. Working to the client’s brief for a “rugged” house, he took advantage of the aggressive nature of concrete, designing a plan based on strong horizontal lines and slim vertical columns. To add texture to the two-storey staircase well, he created corrugated concrete panels, by pouring the concrete into corrugated iron boxes, and then knocking the edges off to soften the effect a little. The result, as described by the New Zealand Home Journal at the time, was a house that was “tall, strong and beautiful – a series of concrete planes – the height balanced by jutting glass-fronted balconies and horizontal concrete beams.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"351\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThirty years later, a new set of owners approached architectural partnership Fearon Hay, looking to restructure the house to meet their needs. “Right from the start they told us that they had a great piece of New Zealand architecture that they believed had serious iconic value but the family didn’t fit into the house,” recalls Fearon. “They wanted to reinvent it for their needs.” With a large family, the new owners wanted to expand the house’s small bedrooms and create areas of separation for the parents and the children. “What we had to do was find out what was in the original building structure that was essential,” says Fearon. Although the house rests on an enormous, almost half-acre section, the architects were keen to retain the feeling that the house was sitting in a park. “We didn’t want to over-occupy the site and engulf the original building,” Fearon explains. “Eventually we came around to the approach that was built, which was to extend and reformat the building within the main residence, demolish the single-storey garaging and service area at the front of the house and extend the house over both levels to the south and southwest.” The north face was unmodified in terms of the structure, apart from a new balcony leading out from the kitchen and dining room.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"352\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nAfter talking with Sang and looking over the original plans, Fearon and Hay concluded the most important idea to retain was the roof canopy from which the three-storey house seemed to be suspended. “When you take away all of the internal walls, window joinery, cabinetry and furniture of the existing building you’re left with a series of two-to-three storey concrete sheer walls, arranged in a Cartesian configuration, so they slide north-south and east-west, past each other,” says Fearon. “The way that the essential concrete walls are arranged is quite dynamic. It’s these very elegantly spaced blades, beams and columns, and you sort of live around. The house steps all over the place as it pushes out towards various rooms. And it’s that stepping and staggering that allowed us to find a lot of places to grab more space.”','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words Melinda Williams <br />\nPhotography Patrick Reynolds</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>It’s taken more than 30 years, but this monolithic house in Auckland has been honoured with New Zealand’s highest architectural award.</strong></p>\n	<p>“This is the house that Jack built,” runs the old nursery rhyme.

In those days, chic dinner parties were grown-up show-and-tell time as names like Castiglioni, Magistretti, Munari, Sapper and, of course, the ubiquitous Starck spilled like oversized salmon roe from a silver fork.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, design changed. Anonymity became the order of the day. Fukasawa, Irvine and Morrison led the charge with the charismatic understatement of a night raid, creating carefully ‘un-designed’ pieces that added to quality of life in subtle ways. These designers shunned the spotlight, working away in silence and churning out honest, elegant, ‘anti-conversation pieces’. For a few, early millennium years, they were the new faceless face of design. And then came Marcel.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"354\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nFresh out of Holland and unapologetically eccentric, Marcel Wanders is arguably responsible for the renaissance of the flamboyant style cropping up at design fairs and in showrooms worldwide. While his work is not exactly part of the ‘neo-baroque’ trend of recent seasons, his creations are emblematic of a zeitgeist where bigger is better and a sense of dark irony is the key to cachet. \r\n\r\nAn agent provocateur in the increasingly thuggish face of technology, Wanders rails against the rise of machines and computers in modern life, and in design in particular. “We need to enter a new time where machines don’t rule us but we rule the machines,” he insists. “The Bauhaus is over. We have to stop listening to machines, we have to create dreams for humanity.” \r\n\r\nAfter graduating summa cum laude from the Arts Arnhem in 1988, Wanders’ career progressed at a rocket-like pace. He first came to the notice of the international design world back in 1996, when he unveiled his iconic Knotted Chair for Droog Design, the Dutch design collective he co-founded in the early ‘90s. In the Knotted Chair Wanders gave the world a taste of his particular form of irony. It’s a structure that brings to mind rope ladders; the shonky and unstable stairways into the mouldy treehouses of our collective childhood. Wanders subverts this by creating something that to the eye appears unstable and insignificant, but by infusing the rope with resin he renders it as strong as timber. The result is a piece which is inarguably elegant and yet in some way perplexing, even pleasantly disconcerting.\r\n\r\nIn fact, ‘pleasantly disconcerting’ would appear to be Wanders’ design philosophy, and it is a design philosophy that sells. In recent years Wanders has been courted by the world’s leading design houses, all eager to offer the Dutch wunderkind the chance to update and interpret their sometimes stuffy corporate images. While he remains at heart a designer of furniture and accessories, Wanders attacks buildings and handbags with the same other-worldly aplomb. For Italian luggage brand Mandarina Duck, he created a range of improbably strange bags, WanderDuck, where the time-honoured technique of glass blowing was applied to luggage. Fabric was heated and inflated, and leather straps attached with oddly compelling results. Wanders was also entrusted with the design of Mandarina Duck’s London flagship store. His concept was a vast interactive space with multiple mezzanines framing a giant three-story high rubber-ducky-yellow mannequin. Yet despite these grandiose, theatrical gestures, Wanders believes that the key to successful lies in its invisibility. “People only notice design when it fails in its objectives. It is my task to make them love it when it works.” \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"355\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nWanders’ unique approach has meant even the grande dames of design have been clamouring for a slice of his action. Ongoing collaborations with Cappellini, Magis, Moroso, Bisazza, Poliform and Driade have all borne strangely desirable fruits. Wanders is always given carte blanche, and pursues his idiosyncratic vision to the bewildered delight of onlookers and design pundits alike. His jewel-like Stone stool/side table for Kartell is a perfect example of his ability to create a product in perfect harmony with the design philosophy of an established brand, while exploring and developing his own style. Stone is the classic ‘plastic’ Kartell stool, rendered ‘Wanders’ by the faceting of the plastic. The intersecting lines bring to mind his crocheted credenzas and tables, or the Knotted Chair. Compare this with the Dream Bed he created for Poliform, a relatively simple piece with pared-back lines and traditional materials, but curiously oversized dimensions. And the requests for more just keep coming, including a range of products for Puma and the creation of a perfume for Cacharel.\r\n\r\nWorking with established brands is designers’ bread and butter, but as in any relationship, there are limits. It was perhaps with this in mind that in 2002 Wanders co-founded Moooi, a new brand where boundaries simply do not exist. As artistic director, in the last five years he has created a brand that has rocked the design world to its foundations. \r\n\r\nMoooi was born with the goal of changing the marketplace to a “vibrant, innovative, interesting and captivating place, inspiring our clientele to make their surroundings to be magic, supportive and sizzlingly beautiful.” And it has succeeded. Proof of this success abounded at this year’s Milan Furniture Fair. Moooi presented their latest collection at three separate events at the Fiera, in the hip ‘Zona Tortona’ area, and in the B&B Italia showroom. Last year B&B Italia, perhaps one of the most established names in the design pantheon bought a 50 percent stake in Moooi. This was no case of noblesse oblige, but rather, of simple economics for the Italian powerhouse.  In the incredibly competitive international design market, B&B realised they needed a shot of the energy and cult credibility that Moooi has in bucketloads. It was a marriage that certainly got people talking, but which seems to be flourishing.\r\n\r\nWhile Wanders’ doesn’t personally design everything for Moooi, the pieces on show all mirror in some way his values. From the ubiquitous Horse Lamp by Front design to the range of papier-maché furniture by Studio Job, Moooi is a brand which mixes surrealism with nostalgia and which has met with resounding commercial success internationally. \r\n\r\nAcross the road from the Moooi exhibition in Milan was the Marcel Wanders’ Personal Edition; over 1800 square metres of ex-industrial exhibition space where Wanders let his creativity reign supreme. On show were pieces from his Wanders’ Wonders collection: his range of handcrafted, limited edition pieces. The collection walked the fine line between art and design: oversized lamps, crocheted armchairs and credenzas, giant hand-painted bells, all presented in a space with heavily patterned carpets and minimal lighting. It was a glimpse into what it might be like to have taken an acid trip, only to be summoned to Grandmother’s house for afternoon tea. Visitors shuffled, mouths agape, among the works – scale blown out of proportion, giant objects in a vast yet oppressive space. This was Wanders creating the world as he sees it; a beautiful, elegant, strange world with life-size crocheted dog statues and golden upholstery fabrics adorned with his face (replete with his signature ‘party nose’). “I have no rules for my creativity, I will always find inspiration,” he asserts. “Even in the most impossible places or situations, inspiration will always be there.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"356\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nIf the idea of immersing yourself in the Wonderful World of Wanders, and glimpsing his view of the world appeals, then you are in luck. In New York, at the pathologically chic Rivington Hotel, you can quaff your champagne in the Wanders-designed Thor bar and restaurant. The public spaces of the hotel are typical of Wanders’ interior architecture: spaces within spaces, the contrast between curvilinear forms and rigid rationalism, the preponderance of pattern. These stylistic motives are echoed in the Lute Suites, a series of seven 18th century cottages on the same street in central Amsterdam. Each suite is decorated with Marcel Wanders’ exacting and distinctive eye for detail.  \r\n\r\nHis latest venture is the joining of forces with the hip hoteliers behind The Mondrian South Beach, which opened this year. For the project Wanders has created a fairy-tale setting, where gardens and castle-like interiors mix and flow. An oversized chandelier hangs above the outdoor pool. An ‘auditorium’ concept has been used for the rooms, which are distributed in a circle around the central gardens, like private boxes at the theatre. According to Wanders, “everyone has the best seat in the house.” And what seats! The colour palate is understated: white, gold, browns, greys, blues and blacks dominate, and every single detail – lamp, table, chair – is a Marcel Wanders original. \r\n\r\nWanders’ goal is to identify and understand the “universal needs of people. I want to create durable objects that will stay with them for long time. We aren’t looking to change the idea of style. Fixing the idea of style is like fixing life – and therefore to die.” With covetable collaborations under his belt, and a slew of awards including Designer of the Year (Elle Decoration International Design Awards 2006) and being listed as one the 25 ‘Stars of Europe’ (Business Week, 2002), recognition from his peers and the world at large have come side-by-side with commercial success. Marcel Wanders is a living example of why you should never make fun of the weird kid at school.','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words Oliver Chidley</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>Rebelling against minimalism and techno-reliance, Dutch designer Marcel Wanders is busy creating his own weird and wanderful world.</strong></p>\n	<p>Like the supermodels before them, the ‘star designers’ of the 1990s were thought to be a thing of the past; vestiges of the design world’s roaring heyday when the aspiration of every upwardly mobile 30-something was to fill every centimetre of their life with paraphernalia by one of the ‘big names’.

But what was intended to be an affordable holiday house for Kiwis to plonk on their increasingly expensive little slices of paradise quickly saw an upward price spiral of its own, as buyers went for higher and higher specifications on the basic plan. \r\n\r\nSeven years later, Hodgskin is having a second crack at the well-designed-but-affordable prefab holiday home: the iPad. Developed by Hodgskin and his partner Russell Cannons at Architex, the kitset building is half the size of its predecessor and is unabashedly minimal: a 40sqm studio that is based on a standard 1.2 metre panel unit, with a clip-on service area comprising the kitchen and bathroom. The room can be divided into two spaces by a fold-down double bed divider. And for just $125,000 it can be delivered to your holiday section in a flatpack, ready for assembly like an IKEA bookcase.\r\n\r\nBut simple doesn’t mean simplistic. The choice to base the design on a standard 1.2m module means there is no cutting or finishing required for the panels, saving money on production and installation. The floor-to-ceiling glass panels along the front and two sides of the design slide back into packing-crate style pockets, which also provide screening for privacy and shelter.

MW','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>Proving to be both a dab hand at modular architecture and catchy names, Andre Hodgskin is launching the new Kiwi bach.</strong></p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"358\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>When architect Andre Hodgskin launched the Bachkit in 2000, the chic, modular holiday home was an instant hit, garnering international attention and high praise from architectural critics. But what was intended to be an affordable holiday house for Kiwis to plonk on their increasingly expensive little slices of paradise quickly saw an upward price spiral of its own, as buyers went for higher and higher specifications on the basic plan. </p>\n	<p>Seven years later, Hodgskin is having a second crack at the well-designed-but-affordable prefab holiday home: the iPad. Developed by Hodgskin and his partner Russell Cannons at Architex, the kitset building is half the size of its predecessor and is unabashedly minimal: a 40sqm studio that is based on a standard 1.2 metre panel unit, with a clip-on service area comprising the kitchen and bathroom. The room can be divided into two spaces by a fold-down double bed divider. And for just $125,000 it can be delivered to your holiday section in a flatpack, ready for assembly like an IKEA bookcase.</p>\n	<p>But simple doesn’t mean simplistic. The choice to base the design on a standard 1.2m module means there is no cutting or finishing required for the panels, saving money on production and installation. The floor-to-ceiling glass panels along the front and two sides of the design slide back into packing-crate style pockets, which also provide screening for privacy and shelter. Creosote exteriors and white bleached timber floors (although all elements can be customized) give the design a relaxed, but modern feel. “It has a real ‘beach’ feel, a nice, natural feel, but it’s created in a sophisticated way,” says Hodgskin.</p>\n	<p>And if you love the design but don’t have a beach section (yet), don’t worry – the iPad can work just as well as a granny flat, backyard studio, site unit or temporary house.

And if we’re fans of anything, we’re fans of extravagance. (And champagne.) And the new bar/restaurant Magnum on Auckland’s Ponsonby Road doesn’t disappoint. The latest offering from restaurateurs Blair Russell and Mark Wallbank (Rocco, Blake St Café), Magnum is on the site of the former long-time occupant Bella. Bella, a friendly neighbourhood restaurant had a troubled history – once a popular bistro, it struggled constantly after the restaurant was temporarily and disastrously transformed into Hell’s Kitchen for the television programme of the same name. Now, after a full-scale renovation and name change, it looks like Wallbank’s magic touch (he rescued the similarly ill-fated spot on the corner of Ponsonby Rd and Hepburn with Rocco) has ended the site’s run of bad luck.\r\n\r\nThe position, for a start, is almost impeccable. Situated on the eastern side of Ponsonby Road, it’s one of the few restaurants on the road that enjoys full afternoon sun, perfect for long lunches or summer evening cocktails. Wallbank has taken full advantage of it, with seating for up to 20 people out front, shaded by an enormous white canopy, protected from wind by clear plastic shields and edged with long planters of small trees that separate the area from the street while still allowing people-watching. The front of the building is lined with pale columns, alternated with double-height glass French doors. Vertical gold metal panels on either side of the entrance announce the establishment’s new name.\r\n\r\nInside, the restaurant has been completely gutted and redesigned. Working with architect Sue Hillery, Wallbank says he was looking for a “1950s Palm Springs” feel. In the former space, the bar was at the back on the right, with the left of the restaurant divided into banquette seating and freestanding tables towards the front. Now the bar is in the centre of the main dining space, with the front of the restaurant a cocktail space with high tables and stools, and a wide gold-topped>  < walnut-fronted reception desk. Above the desk hang two 10-legged, spider-like lights that Wallbank sourced from Ken Neale, a Sydney-based New Zealander with an eye for amazing vintage design.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the cocktail area is a marble fireplace, with a huge, gold pleated panel above, and to the right is a floor-to-ceiling mirror with the current menu of small plates written on it. The key motif throughout the space is a repeated M or elongated diamond shape, which is found in the black steel grille behind the reception desk, cut out of the light covers and reflected in the pleats of the panel above the fireplace. High, round glossy black tables dot the front of the space, ringed by dark brown barstools with low bucket seats, made by Forma Furniture.\r\n\r\nIn the main restaurant space, the focus is on the bar in the centre, which is surrounded by low-mounted bar stools for Japanese yakitori-style dining. “The centralised bar was something I really wanted to do, so we started with that,” says Wallbank. “A lot of people like to eat alone these days, or like to eat at the bar. It’s always a lot more fun there.” Above the bar a massive, translucent lightbox with a motif grille conceals the bottle and glass stock. Down the length of both sides of the restaurant, deep bronze seating with long roll backs face off across small black tables with low black Eames-style chairs. “We wanted to play with the heights of the chairs. All the different styles are at different heights throughout the restaurant.” Above the banquette seating, the M motif is again stitching into champagne-coloured padded panels, while mirrors along the top allow for covert surveillance of fellow diners.\r\n\r\nMatching the colour scheme of black, smoke grey walnut and taupe, the restaurant crockery eschews the traditional white palette and instead consists of chunky Temuka pottery in dark browns, blacks and sweet duck-egg blue, alongside wooden bowls. Wallbank describes the food as “classic bistro fare; a lot of comfort food, but with a twist.” We won’t even need a magnum of champagne to tempt us along.

Being able to wave over the fence is fine; being able to stare into their bathroom window as they brush their teeth in the morning is not. And as city-fringe suburbs fill in wherever there’s a piece of land big enough to squeeze a house on, preserving privacy is becoming increasingly difficult.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"393\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nDesigner David Ponting took on that challenge when he was asked to design two new houses on a site in Herne Bay, Auckland. Although he didn’t have a strict brief of specifications the houses should conform to, the site demanded some lateral thinking to avoid uncomfortably close neighbourly relations. To solve it, and create a unifying theme between the two houses, Ponting played with ideas of reversal and opposition. Standing on the driveway between the two buildings, he points out how the lower floor of one is rendered predominantly in white, and the upstairs in black, and how the other reverses the colours. The house on the left, he says, was designed to have a more feminine feel, while the house on the right reflects a more masculine sensibility. “When I was given the brief, there was no particular client in mind, so I was able to create a house that I might want to live in myself,” he says.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside, the ‘masculine’ house is a closed book, with high, blank walls, a wide, smooth panel of a front door and only one block of small windows visible on the second floor. A huge oak tree stands sentry to one side of the door. Standing on the doorstep, you have no idea of what might be contained within. As the wide door swings open, a surprisingly spacious hallway is revealed: soaring black anthra-zinc panels and a stairway rising to the left towards a double-height atrium and a lounge overlooking a lap pool and vivid aqua feature wall ahead. “You come from outside the enclosure, where there’s a real sense of being ‘outside’ and the moment you pass through the threshold, it’s a very dramatic experience and hopefully you just go, ‘Wow!’ and understand why it’s special to be in here,” says Ponting.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"394\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe house is designed with what Ponting calls a “black shed” at ground level, which houses the garage. Above, a white box sits on top, and interlinks with the black box on the interior. To the right, a glassed pavilion space surrounded by a slim garden and courtyard walls houses the main living areas. “The house is a garden courtyard, where the ‘fences’ work as the walls of the house,” Ponting explains. “The idea is that you experience the outside of the house; the courtyard walls become the exterior walls of the house.” Ponting worked with a landscaping company Second Nature to create a simple but dramatic garden that sandwiched between the floor-to-ceiling glass walls of the kitchen/dining space, and the high, white courtyard walls that provide the house’s privacy. “There wasn’t going to be anything beyond the perimeter of the site to treat as a positive, so we created an environment that creates a sense of expansion within the property,” he says. “The outer walls are as far away as they can be – that was the start of expanding the space, and then we layered the space inwards, so you’ve got the layer of white, then the layer of planting, then the layer of the floor and rooms, as things move into the middle. The kitchen is the middle of the property.”\r\n\r\nThe kitchen island, designed by Ponting in conjunction with Morgan Cronin Kitchens, was envisaged as a piece of furniture rather than a ‘room’. Smooth and white, with concealed drawers and cupboards, it seems to float a couple of inches above the floor. “I designed the layout and the form of the space, then Morgan and I talked through the details and he went away and really refined the details to another level again. It’s that extra level of polish that he puts into it that makes his kitchens so sexy. We’ve worked on three projects together now and I really look forward to the next one.”\r\n\r\nThe pared-back look of the house is partially a response to the other townhouse Ponting worked on at the same time. “This house is a step away from something else that had been done as much as it is something in its own right. I really wanted this to feel simple; the other house is more complex, more textured, more organic. Here there’s sort of a frictionless quality to the objects that you pass by. You just drift past everything.” That simplicity, and the minimal palette, makes the pop of colour from the aqua pool wall even more arresting. “That was really important. It’s super-dull if a house has no noticeable colour texture. You’ve got to have it somewhere. I saw it as a sculptural object that adds a sense of depth to the outlook.” \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"395\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nDepth was important in many ways. The anthra-zinc wall panels, for example, were chosen in charcoal instead of the usual lead colour because it had a grained effect, almost like a wood panel. “There’s more of an ability to look into it, whereas the lighter colours have more of a feel of being a ‘surface’. It doesn’t look as machine-made as it actually is. It could overpower a room really easily but because it does have a softness on the eye, it’s a dark but friendly object.”\r\n\r\nUpstairs, above the black box, the stairwell opens up into a gallery space that could be used as a children’s play area or a library. Light pours in from skylights in the ceiling. “One of the really important aspects of a site with a lack of privacy is to have as few windows on the outside as possible, and lots of ‘holes’ in the roof. That gives plenty of light and a sense of space, and it’s really central to the enjoyment of this atrium,” says Ponting. At the front end of the house, two bedrooms look out at the big oak tree at the front of the house through paneled windows. “These rooms get the tree as part of their experience, as opposed to the neighbours’ houses,” he says. “It’s a very compressed environment. It wasn’t about putting windows everywhere. It was about making sure that there was sun, light and a filtered outlook, but then leaving a box, leaving it to read as a strong box without too many incisions in it.” At the other end is the master suite, the only room in the house with a view unimpeded by neighbours, looking out over a city-owned organic garden collective, a sea of banana palms and a sliver of Cox’s Bay. \r\n\r\nDescribing the house as essentially “a high-value apartment on a section” Ponting says he’s pleased with the way his play on opposite’s has worked out. “It’s a masculine house and the other house is very feminine, so it’s the idea of the yin/yang, the black and the white, and the white and the black. I wanted the rooms to feel strong, to have a sense of security about them, so it feels relaxing to be there. And although people aren’t used to walls that are 2.7 metres high, there’s no sense of claustrophobia, because the space is expansive.”\r\n\r\n','<txp:if_individual_article>\n	<p><em>Words Melinda Williams<br />\nStyling Danielle Bates <br />\nPhotography Simon Devitt</em></p>\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n	<p><strong>Black and white, indoors and outdoors, old and new –  a designer plays with opposites in this new luxury townhouse.</strong></p>\n	<p>Although most Kiwis have given up on the 1950s quarter-acre dream, we still cling to the hope that living in the suburbs means having enough space that we don’t have to be intimately acquainted with the details of our neighbours’ everyday lives.

These few are for travellers who are in search of something beyond the standard ideals of luxury, who are seeking something more exclusive, quirky and imaginative in a design hotel. These hotels represent the premier accommodations in the world’s most spectacular cities – be it a historic mansion in Paris or a high-tech architectural marvel in Budapest, each one exceeds the highest standards for service, ambience and amenities for those in search of an urban escape. An interesting trend with these new design hotels is a focus on creating eclectic, uniquely designed individual rooms, each with a completely different aesthetic and often featuring whimsical elements. After all, if you’ve travelled halfway across the globe to see a new city, who wants McDonalds-like predictability in their hotel room? \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"396\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nHotel Everland - Paris			\r\n\"www.everland.ch\":http://www.everland.ch\r\nHotel Everland is a project by Swiss artist-duo L/B (Sabina Lang and Daniel Baumann). L/B are known for their installations that deal with architecture and space and invite the viewer to get involved and become part of the artwork. Everland is a hotel like no other – it has only one room, which includes a king-size bed and a lounge, with a bathroom branching off to the side. The substantial space is decorated in bright Pop colours with playful details, like the written encouragement to steal the golden embroidered bath towels. But the hotel’s most unique feature is that it is constantly on the move. At the artists’ request, the transportable room can be booked for one night only, during which time you’ll be expected to drink the fully-stocked mini-bar dry (it’s included in the price), enjoy breakfast delivered to the door and try out your best dance moves to the sounds of the record collection. The travelling hotel has moved from Switzerland to Germany and is now in Paris until the end of 2008. High above the city, with a view of the Eiffel Tower, it is installed on the roof of Palais de Tokyo.\r\nRooms from $625. \r\n\r\nHotel Fasano -São Paulo, Brazil	\r\n\"www.fasano.com.br\":http://www.fasano.com.br\r\nWith more than a century of experience in the food business behind them, the Fasano family of São Paulo turned their hand to providing a more complete guest experience. Fasano Hotel and Restaurant has resulted from a design collaboration between Isay Weinfeld and Márcio Kogan, recreating an audacious 1930s style. Elegant architecture combines contemporary design with classical wealth of detail, such as period furniture, massive leather armchairs and English red brickwork on the facade. The hotel houses two of the icons of the area: Fasano, rated South America’s best restaurant for Italian cuisine, and the Baretto Bar, a cozy space for cool music and jazz. The Fasano is one of those places  you go not to hide but to be seen, and the view from the armchairs is of a constant parade of well-heeled travelers and fashionable Paulistanos flowing through reception and into Baretto. The hotel is located in the elegant neighbourhood of Jardins and is surrounded by São Paulo’s finest shops and boutiques, including Empório Armani, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, Bulgari and Cartier. \r\nRooms from $560. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"398\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nHotel du Petit Moulin - Paris, France				\r\n\"www.paris-hotel-petitmoulin.com\":http://www.paris-hotel-petitmoulin.com\r\nCouturier Christian Lacroix is the name behind the interior design of the Hotel du Petit Moulin lying in the heart of Le Marais, the historic area of Paris. This 17th century building, the site of an ancient boulangerie, has been completely renovated, although the facade dating back to 1900 and the shop sign, both of which are registered as historic monuments, have been preserved. “I always loved the idea of hotels, of the journey around a room”, enthuses Lacroix; hence he has created 17 atmospheres for each of the 17 rooms at the hotel. Entering the reception area you are greeted with illustrations by Lacroix, a 17th-century wooden staircase leading to the bar, with bright 1960s armchairs, and in the lift, a rococo scene sets the tone for the individually-designed rooms. “Each of the rooms corresponds to a way of approaching this area of Paris where you don’t go downstairs by chance but rather because you are drawn by the history and the spirit of the times,” Lacroix declares. The style of the rooms varies wildly, from rustic cosiness decorated with Jouy Linen, to a more Zen and design-orientated style; from elegant classic cornices, to spaces that could almost be described as kitsch. \r\nRooms from $350.\r\n\r\nLánchíd 19 - Budapest, Hungary\r\n\"www.lanchid19hotel.hu\":http://www.lanchid19hotel.hu	\r\nNamed after Budapest’s famed “Chain Bridge” which spans the Danube, the Lánchíd 19 is a contemporary highlight in a neighbourhood of predominately 19th century architecture. This contrast is indicative of Budapest’s evolving character, one which celebrates both past and present. The architect and design team of Péter Sugár, Lászlo Benczur and Lászlo Kara have created a moveable accordion-like glass façade, animated by the changing colours of an innovative lighting design concept. It provides unique pictures in the night, so the hotel stands as a kind of ‘lighthouse’ on the Danube riverbank. A building-high glass atrium towers above the foyer enabling natural light to flood the communal spaces and glass bridges that lead to the guestrooms. A glass and steel staircase connects the foyer with a restaurant, which is located on a gallery above. The lobby itself is equally dramatic with its transparent floor revealing Roman ruins a level below. History is well integrated into the interior design, where classical-modern design icons, such as chairs by Alvar Aalto, are mixed with custom-designed furnishings. \r\nRooms from $215.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"399\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nMondrian Scottsdale - Arizona, USA\r\n\"www.mondrianscottsdale.com\":http://www.mondrianscottsdale.com	It just got even hotter in Arizona with the arrival of the Mondrian Scottsdale, designed by rising international star Benjamin Noriega-Ortiz. The hotel is an inventive vision of modern glamour drawing inspiration from the Garden of Eden: the lobby features cloudlike lighting while the temptations of the Red Bar (shown here) are encapsulated by a single, oversized apple, red drapes and cherubs flying overhead. The Skybar, accessed from the gardens, is draped in decadent black gauze and furnished with black wing chairs and an enormous, luxurious bed for relaxing and star-gazing. This urban resort reflects the youthful spirit of the thriving city of Old Town Scottsdale. From the street, only walls and lush gardens are visible. Through the iconic 25-foot Mondrian “gates” (fashioned entirely from tropical bougainvillea), visitors enter the hotel via a sweeping entranceway blanketed by a virtual red carpet of stencilled leaves. The 194 rooms inspired by ‘good and evil’ are designed entirely in black and white and include Philippe Stark Louis Ghost chairs. Maybe the most tempting part of the property is the Asia de Cuba restaurant (overseen by renowned international restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow) with its references to farm life and abundance it features the designer’s taxadermic rooster as the star of the show. \r\nRooms from $380.\r\n\r\nLux 11 -Berlin, Germany	\r\n\"www.lux11.com\":http://www.lux11.com	\r\nBerlin is one of UNESCO Creative Cities of design and it has a distinctive and strong creative subculture, particularly in the Mitte district, a historic area with one-of-a-kind fashion boutiques, bars, art galleries, studios and restaurants. Bang in the heart of Mitte is where you find the Lux 11, a chic 72-room apartment hotel designed by London-based architects Giuliana Salmaso and Claudio Silvestrin. The clean minimal design includes celadon walls and bleached wood furniture with a colour scheme of muted Chinese green and white. Floors are polished concrete or Scandanavian wood, but other materials are sumptuous, such as the suede headboards and taffeta bedcovers trimmed with fake fur. A huge highlight at Lux 11 is the Shiro i Shiro restaurant with its innovative cuisine (Mediterranean-Japanese), including an impressively designed sushi bar. Also on the ground floor, is the hotel’s Aveda salon and spa and Ulf Haines, a concept store that sells minimalist fashion gear. The crowd are stylish international visitors, in town to experience East Berlin’s creative art scene, shops and nightlife. \r\nRooms from $310.\r\n\r\nHotel Particulier Montmartre - Paris	\r\n\"www.hotel-particulier-montmartre.com\":http://www.hotel-particulier-montmartre.com	\r\nThe most fabulous example of a hotel combining drama, surprise, and luxury is hiding in a secret passage in the heart of the historical, artistic and night-club area of Montmartre in Paris. The restored aristocratic mansion from the Directoire period is the project of Morgane Rousseau and Frédéric Comtet. The owners commissioned well known artists, designers and architects to create the five unique suites. One of the distinctive rooms is the “vegetable room” designed by New York-born, Paris-based contemporary artist Martine Aballéa. Aballéa hopes guests will “feel like they were in a suspended garden or in trees, to have a sensation of floating in a luminous, soft and flowered space”. From every window, residents can view the luxuriant garden created by Louis Bénech (designer of the Jardin des Tuileries). Finland-born Mats Haglund of Chanel, Colette and Paul Joe boutique fame, created the private living room, using the personality of the proprietors as his starting point and furnished the salon with classics by Arne Jacobsen, Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto.\r\nRooms from $730.\r\n\r\nAll prices are approximate and in New Zealand dollars.

The Fasano is one of those places  you go not to hide but to be seen, and the view from the armchairs is of a constant parade of well-heeled travelers and fashionable Paulistanos flowing through reception and into Baretto. The hotel is located in the elegant neighbourhood of Jardins and is surrounded by São Paulo’s finest shops and boutiques, including Empório Armani, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, Bulgari and Cartier. <br />\nRooms from $560. </p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"398\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>Hotel du Petit Moulin &#8211; Paris, France<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.paris-hotel-petitmoulin.com\">www.paris-hotel-petitmoulin.com</a><br />\nCouturier Christian Lacroix is the name behind the interior design of the Hotel du Petit Moulin lying in the heart of Le Marais, the historic area of Paris. This 17th century building, the site of an ancient boulangerie, has been completely renovated, although the facade dating back to 1900 and the shop sign, both of which are registered as historic monuments, have been preserved. “I always loved the idea of hotels, of the journey around a room”, enthuses Lacroix; hence he has created 17 atmospheres for each of the 17 rooms at the hotel. Entering the reception area you are greeted with illustrations by Lacroix, a 17th-century wooden staircase leading to the bar, with bright 1960s armchairs, and in the lift, a rococo scene sets the tone for the individually-designed rooms. “Each of the rooms corresponds to a way of approaching this area of Paris where you don’t go downstairs by chance but rather because you are drawn by the history and the spirit of the times,” Lacroix declares. The style of the rooms varies wildly, from rustic cosiness decorated with Jouy Linen, to a more Zen and design-orientated style; from elegant classic cornices, to spaces that could almost be described as kitsch. <br />\nRooms from $350.</p>\n	<p>Lánchíd 19 &#8211; Budapest, Hungary<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.lanchid19hotel.hu\">www.lanchid19hotel.hu</a><br />\nNamed after Budapest’s famed “Chain Bridge” which spans the Danube, the Lánchíd 19 is a contemporary highlight in a neighbourhood of predominately 19th century architecture. This contrast is indicative of Budapest’s evolving character, one which celebrates both past and present. The architect and design team of Péter Sugár, Lászlo Benczur and Lászlo Kara have created a moveable accordion-like glass façade, animated by the changing colours of an innovative lighting design concept. It provides unique pictures in the night, so the hotel stands as a kind of ‘lighthouse’ on the Danube riverbank. A building-high glass atrium towers above the foyer enabling natural light to flood the communal spaces and glass bridges that lead to the guestrooms. A glass and steel staircase connects the foyer with a restaurant, which is located on a gallery above. The lobby itself is equally dramatic with its transparent floor revealing Roman ruins a level below. History is well integrated into the interior design, where classical-modern design icons, such as chairs by Alvar Aalto, are mixed with custom-designed furnishings. <br />\nRooms from $215.</p>\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"399\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\n	<p>Mondrian Scottsdale &#8211; Arizona, USA<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.mondrianscottsdale.comIt\">www.mondrianscottsdale.com</a> just got even hotter in Arizona with the arrival of the Mondrian Scottsdale, designed by rising international star Benjamin Noriega-Ortiz. The hotel is an inventive vision of modern glamour drawing inspiration from the Garden of Eden: the lobby features cloudlike lighting while the temptations of the Red Bar (shown here) are encapsulated by a single, oversized apple, red drapes and cherubs flying overhead. The Skybar, accessed from the gardens, is draped in decadent black gauze and furnished with black wing chairs and an enormous, luxurious bed for relaxing and star-gazing. This urban resort reflects the youthful spirit of the thriving city of Old Town Scottsdale. From the street, only walls and lush gardens are visible. Through the iconic 25-foot Mondrian “gates” (fashioned entirely from tropical bougainvillea), visitors enter the hotel via a sweeping entranceway blanketed by a virtual red carpet of stencilled leaves. The 194 rooms inspired by ‘good and evil’ are designed entirely in black and white and include Philippe Stark Louis Ghost chairs. Maybe the most tempting part of the property is the Asia de Cuba restaurant (overseen by renowned international restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow) with its references to farm life and abundance it features the designer’s taxadermic rooster as the star of the show. <br />\nRooms from $380.</p>\n	<p>Lux 11 -Berlin, Germany<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.lux11.com\">www.lux11.com</a><br />\nBerlin is one of UNESCO Creative Cities of design and it has a distinctive and strong creative subculture, particularly in the Mitte district, a historic area with one-of-a-kind fashion boutiques, bars, art galleries, studios and restaurants. Bang in the heart of Mitte is where you find the Lux 11, a chic 72-room apartment hotel designed by London-based architects Giuliana Salmaso and Claudio Silvestrin. The clean minimal design includes celadon walls and bleached wood furniture with a colour scheme of muted Chinese green and white. Floors are polished concrete or Scandanavian wood, but other materials are sumptuous, such as the suede headboards and taffeta bedcovers trimmed with fake fur. A huge highlight at Lux 11 is the Shiro i Shiro restaurant with its innovative cuisine (Mediterranean-Japanese), including an impressively designed sushi bar. Also on the ground floor, is the hotel’s Aveda salon and spa and Ulf Haines, a concept store that sells minimalist fashion gear. The crowd are stylish international visitors, in town to experience East Berlin’s creative art scene, shops and nightlife. <br />\nRooms from $310.</p>\n	<p>Hotel Particulier Montmartre &#8211; Paris<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.hotel-particulier-montmartre.com\">www.hotel-particulier-montmartre.com</a><br />\nThe most fabulous example of a hotel combining drama, surprise, and luxury is hiding in a secret passage in the heart of the historical, artistic and night-club area of Montmartre in Paris. The restored aristocratic mansion from the Directoire period is the project of Morgane Rousseau and Frédéric Comtet. The owners commissioned well known artists, designers and architects to create the five unique suites. One of the distinctive rooms is the “vegetable room” designed by New York-born, Paris-based contemporary artist Martine Aballéa. Aballéa hopes guests will “feel like they were in a suspended garden or in trees, to have a sensation of floating in a luminous, soft and flowered space”. From every window, residents can view the luxuriant garden created by Louis Bénech (designer of the Jardin des Tuileries). Finland-born Mats Haglund of Chanel, Colette and Paul Joe boutique fame, created the private living room, using the personality of the proprietors as his starting point and furnished the salon with classics by Arne Jacobsen, Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto.<br />\nRooms from $730.</p>\n	<p>All prices are approximate and in New Zealand dollars. </p>\n\n ','','\n\n ','/images/397.jpg','mag-article','issue41',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','the-first-resorts','','','','','','','','','','','5fb7b3a6174f6779ec144e2efa0e8ff9','2007-11-23'),(211,'2007-11-23 11:57:00','gabrielle.mirkin','2007-11-26 06:04:44','gabrielle.mirkin','Here to Help','','<txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\n\r\n</txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\n*It’s no longer hard to find good help these days – just as long as you have the right stuff in your pocket.*\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"400\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nYou’ve just stepped off the plane in a new city.

More than 3000 design-lovers descended upon 16 design showrooms around the central city, Parnell, Ponsonby, Newmarket and Mt Eden to see interior installations created by the country’s top fashion designers. With their bright red shoulder bags and necktags denoting them as part of the Designday crowd, the attendees wandered happily between showrooms or caught a ride in one of the fleet of 40 Jerry Clayton BMWs (saving their energy for drinking champagne and cocktails instead).\r\n\r\nThis year, the fashion designers stepped the standard up another notch, creating a series of glamorous and extravagant installations. At ECC, Zambesi designed a surreal space where mannequins adorned in Zambesi garments and sporting enormous lights as hats almost seemed to float above the mirrored floor. Smoky, downbeat music drawn from the soundtracks to Pedro Almodovar films played, as in the background the film Women On the Verge Of a Nervous Breakdown flickered ghostily on one wall. Deservedly, the tableau won the Best Installation award, as voted by attendees using the Apple iMacs on hand at each showroom. Close behind in the popularity stakes was the set-up at Apartmento, designed by Taylor Boutique, where models wearing Taylor’s latest collection and zombie-like makeup lolled elegantly alongside a skeleton at a very-last-supper scene.\r\n\r\nIn Mt Eden, colour was the order of the day, with Ruby creating a glamorous apartment living area, hung about with bright fans and paper lanterns and backed with a wall-size city nightscape. Over at Cite, World’s installation was an over-the-top political standoff, with ‘rooms’ created for ‘John’ and ‘Helen’, and a quartet of outrageously dressed mannequins posing among a riot of coloured balloons in the window box. Out at Bos Design, Sarah Riley suspended shoes in an elegant vitrine installation and adorned mannequins in patterned dresses that matched nearby furniture pieces.\r\n \r\nThe perfect weather was just right for the poolside lounging theme at Domo, where models clad in Lola by Rachel Hunter bikinis giggled on Dedon chaises while bare-chested cocktail waiters handed around trays of nibbles. The piece de resistance was the enormous paddling pool in the centre of the showroom, with clouds of silvery dolphin balloons floating above. It was no surprise when the showroom won the people’s choice prize for Best Ambience. Downstairs, at Ligne Roset, the mood couldn’t have been more different – the shadowy, futuristic showroom was punctuated with vividly coloured groupings of furniture and dresses from Cybele’s latest collection.\r\n\r\nArt, both still and live action, brought colour to the clean, minimal décor at Simon James. Upstairs, Richard Orjis’ surreal floral portraits added mystery to the ‘bedroom’ set while downstairs in the Huffer installation, artist Josh Paki worked on a wall-sized painting. Across in Ponsonby, a Viking in full costume greeted visitors to Design Denmark, and led them in to check out the installation by Liz Mitchell, using the new plastic Woofy puppies from Normann Copenhagen. Down the road at Hafele, designer Lucie Boshier and her team of exuberantly shrieking Amsterdam ‘madams’ led attendees through a red-lit, lingerie-strewn boudoir to a lavish bedroom where saucily clad models played cards and made eyes at their visitors.\r\n 	\r\nFor punters whose energy was flagging, the Strand was a great place for a pick-me-up. At Poggenpohl, Lonely Hearts served coffee at an all-day café amid a monochromatic installation of chequered cups, hand-made flowers and crockery still-lifes. The black-and-white theme continued along at Matisse, where Stolen Girlfriends’ Club Factory Girl-inspired installation of studio lights, projected film and a louche, black-bobbed model sipping red wine was accompanied by champagne, candyfloss and opera.\r\n\r\nUp the hill at GeorgiGregg Home, the lavish fabrics, vibrant colours, fringed umbrellas and rich scatterings of flowers were inspired by designer Claire Kingan-Jones’ recent trip to India for her brother’s wedding. Turet Knuefermann of TKStore was also inspired by an overseas trip for her installation at Metrix, where lush tropical plants, caipirinhas, colourful butterflies and models in floaty dresses recreated the feel of a Brazilian beach party. The partying was more restrained at Studio Italia, with 1970s-styled Yvonne Bennetti models reclining elegantly next to a pool set-up, nibbling on cocktail snacks.\r\n\r\nMore than a few punters decided to end the day with a drink at Clooney, and were greeted by an elegant, Nom D-clad mannequin, drenched in white paint and topped with a fringed lamp. For those who missed out this time, be sure to be in early to register for next year’s Designday – preparations are already underway.

The piece de resistance was the enormous paddling pool in the centre of the showroom, with clouds of silvery dolphin balloons floating above. It was no surprise when the showroom won the people’s choice prize for Best Ambience. Downstairs, at Ligne Roset, the mood couldn’t have been more different – the shadowy, futuristic showroom was punctuated with vividly coloured groupings of furniture and dresses from Cybele’s latest collection.</p>\n\n	<p>Art, both still and live action, brought colour to the clean, minimal décor at Simon James. Upstairs, Richard Orjis’ surreal floral portraits added mystery to the ‘bedroom’ set while downstairs in the Huffer installation, artist Josh Paki worked on a wall-sized painting. Across in Ponsonby, a Viking in full costume greeted visitors to Design Denmark, and led them in to check out the installation by Liz Mitchell, using the new plastic Woofy puppies from Normann Copenhagen. Down the road at Hafele, designer Lucie Boshier and her team of exuberantly shrieking Amsterdam ‘madams’ led attendees through a red-lit, lingerie-strewn boudoir to a lavish bedroom where saucily clad models played cards and made eyes at their visitors.</p>\n\n	<p>For punters whose energy was flagging, the Strand was a great place for a pick-me-up. At Poggenpohl, Lonely Hearts served coffee at an all-day café amid a monochromatic installation of chequered cups, hand-made flowers and crockery still-lifes. The black-and-white theme continued along at Matisse, where Stolen Girlfriends’ Club Factory Girl-inspired installation of studio lights, projected film and a louche, black-bobbed model sipping red wine was accompanied by champagne, candyfloss and opera.</p>\n\n	<p>Up the hill at GeorgiGregg Home, the lavish fabrics, vibrant colours, fringed umbrellas and rich scatterings of flowers were inspired by designer Claire Kingan-Jones’ recent trip to India for her brother’s wedding. Turet Knuefermann of <span class=\"caps\">TKS</span>tore was also inspired by an overseas trip for her installation at Metrix, where lush tropical plants, caipirinhas, colourful butterflies and models in floaty dresses recreated the feel of a Brazilian beach party. The partying was more restrained at Studio Italia, with 1970s-styled Yvonne Bennetti models reclining elegantly next to a pool set-up, nibbling on cocktail snacks.</p>\n\n	<p>More than a few punters decided to end the day with a drink at Clooney, and were greeted by an elegant, Nom D-clad mannequin, drenched in white paint and topped with a fringed lamp. For those who missed out this time, be sure to be in early to register for next year’s Designday – preparations are already underway.

But there’s no trickery to Adjaye’s appeal – although he loves to play with illusion in his work, his talent is rock-solid. He approaches his projects with an artist’s sensibility, displaying an ingenious use of materials and ability to sculpt light. “I prefer not to make a house look like a house,” he says. “The aim for my buildings is to leave an individual impression based on how they’re experienced.” With this King’s Cross home, once an industrial concrete loading bay, Adjaye has created a glam-chic space with low-budget materials.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"427\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nAdjaye wanted to show how light can be captured and displayed like a beautiful butterfly in a glass bell jar. Daylight cuts through the roof, streaming down into three towering 4.5-metre high transparent rectangular cubes stretching from floor to ceiling, creating an illusion that the light is frozen. “To see the glowing shaft, I had to make sure light wasn’t reflecting everywhere because it would defuse its power,” he says. “All the tones in the space are dark in order to illuminate something which is considered to be weightless and gentle and to become an element that makes the onlooker slightly uneasy at its power and beauty.”\r\n\r\nThe use of mirrors, glass and a very high-gloss concrete floor were chosen to enhance the quality of the light shafts and capture glimpses of the entire area. “What excites me the most about this building is the idea of turning a residential space that could be very dark and depressing into something that’s full of light and exhilarating,” Adjaye enthuses. Displaying the ingenious approach of a young conceptual artist, he hunted down an unusual palette of intriguing materials for the stunning space, plucking them from unfamiliar sources and reinventing them while playing with texture. Squint and you might notice the deluxe, slick, black walls are actually cheap, coarse chipboard and MDF. The high-gloss black floor reflecting like icy water is lacquered concrete, often considered harsh and cold and only suitable for the outdoors. Adjaye pumps things up to the max; he’s not interested in what he calls the “boring, passive, nice stuff”. “I wanted to create a home where the notion of luxury wasn’t defined by the expense of the materials but by the sense, quality, and perception of the space.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"428\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n \r\nThe space is an exploration of the impact of black as the primary shade in this interior, with Adjaye completely avoiding white. He has captured with these dark tones, the same kind of serenity that white spaces do – creating a soothing sense of wellbeing and relaxation. “I was really excited about the concept of stepping away from white-washed walls and using black for nearly everything, yet still creating a tranquil feeling.” With its glass light-filled shafts the living zone has a stunning sci-fi feel. Although it’s hard not to cling to the idea that a home should be cosy and comfortable, this photogenic building wasn’t designed to be safe or reassuring. The owner wanted to be able to hold fashion shows and spectacular events where couture dresses and Christian Louboutin stilettos could strut their stuff.\r\n\r\nStill, it’s a very livable home. The living area connects to the outside courtyard where the owners throw in summer barbeques. The line where the outside begins and the interiors end is blurred, thanks to Adjaye’s ingenious play with reflection. “The idea was to make a space that would be intimate for lounging but also have a connection to the environment and the rest of the house. What I tried to do was really make no rooms at all.” The space is sparsely decorated with carefully chosen pieces of furniture. The leather Barcelona chairs by Mies van der Rohe for Knoll sit opposite a long and sleek fitted concrete seat moulded and designed by Adjaye. After establishing the dark main space Adjaye wanted all the other living zones to be intensely colourful. The acid-green defines the sunken cinema as a snug off the black dining area. “Usually a cinema space like this is black but because we made the [main] space dark we wanted to reverse the norm.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"429\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe waterproof concrete kitchen, designed as an artistic sculpture, picks up on the simple lines of the house. “I am fascinated by the perception of concrete because most people think the material is ugly and just for outdoors but for me you can use, mould and shape it spectacularly indoors too,” Adjaye admits. The laminated glass wall hides a studio and guest bathroom while producing a theatrical quality that life is behind the walls. Part of the old loading bay was recycled to become the bedroom. Designed for intimacy, the owners did not want it to be flooded with light but they did want to see the sky. The square window vista looks out to the middle light shaft in the living space.\r\n\r\nLike all of Adjaye’s projects this house works best when you’re in it. In the living space, as a result of the combination of exposed construction, soaring glass walls and reflective surfaces, there is a continuous interplay between the sturdiness of materials and the momentary effects of light coming from a variety of sources. It’s often difficult to see where the space actually ends, as its length is extended by reflection. Adjaye isn’t interested in functional form but loves the concept of what he calls ‘emotive’ architecture, buildings that prod you to respond. “Spaces should seduce,” he declares. This dark pool of calm provokes a certain atmosphere; it’s nocturnal, alien, almost sinister and very sexy. “I want to make my projects more intense. I like the idea of this home having a sense of the mystery and moment,” he enthuses. “It’s a very glamorous space but it’s also a place where you can meditate and reflect in a spot where it feels like time never moves.”','	<p><txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>_Words Amanda Talbot<br />\nPhotography Henrik Knudsen_</p>\n\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Hotshot architect David Adjaye has created a spacious and dramatic home in King’s Cross, London, using light and dark as focal points.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>A client list that includes actor Ewan McGregor, artists Jake Chapman and Chris Ofili, designer Alexander McQueen, photographer Juergen Teller and a handful of anonymous multimillionaires gives 40-year-old British architect David Adjaye a fashionable allure.

Between the rather depressing tales of Hamlet, The Little Mermaid and the Emperor with no clothes, Danish cultural history can come across as a little gloomy. Fortunately, the same austere spirit that produced Hans Christian Andersen’s morality tales also resulted in the clean, minimalist lines of the furniture designs of luminaries such as Arne Jacobsen, Hans Wegner and Verner Panton. Today, the country’s capital Copenhagen not only enjoys a reputation as one of the great historical design centres of Europe but is also currently undergoing a boom in modern architecture.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"431\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nPerhaps there’s some architectural competition going on between Copenhagen and its cross-harbour neighbour Malmo, in Sweden. While Malmo has enjoyed international attention thanks to Santiago Calatrava’s spectacular Turning Torso tower, Copenhagen has also recently commissioned a host of stunning buildings by famed architects. American Daniel Liebeskind’s Dansk Jødisk Museum (The Jewish Museum) was completed in 2004, and Iraqi-born Zaha Hadid designed the stunning new wing of the art museum Ordrupgaard, just north of Copenhagen, which opened in 2005. Norman Foster designed the new elephant house and enclosure in the Copenhagen Zoo (due to open this year), and Frenchman Jean Nouvel is behind the concert hall of the National Broadcasting Company (planned opening spring 2008). Danish architect Henning Larsen has also been busy, with his glorious new Opera House on the city’s harbourfront and the French wing of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek art museum, which is a masterpiece of light and space.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of Copenhagen’s architectural renaissance, however, is the new extension to the 19th century redbrick Royal Library. The granite and glass building, was first unofficially, and later formally nicknamed “The Black Diamond”, and teeters dramatically over the waterfront, its dark, faceted windows throwing spectacular reflections across the boardwalk. Completed in 1999, the building houses a concert hall, bookshop, café, exhibition space and the restaurant Soren K.\r\n\r\nWhere to Stay:\r\nHotel Twentyseven, Løngangstræde 27, 1468 Copenhagen K \r\nEnergetic and quirky, Hotel Twentyseven is situated in the heart of Copenhagen, just a few metres from the town square. The hotel prides itself on creating a design-savvy, seductive environment that is all about living an ‘uncomplicated life’. Visitors can book a unique Live Life-package, which allows them to sip wine in The Wine Room, experience food and wine from all over the world in the restaurant, enjoy a ‘molecular drink’ at the Honey Ryder Cocktail Lounge and get a cool experience in the exceptional Absolut Icebar Copenhagen, with ice from the Torne-river in Lapland. Extra points to them for having a cocktail bar named after a 007 film character.\r\nwww.hotel27.dk\r\n\r\nRadisson SAS, Falkoner Alle 9, Copenhagen F\r\nThe first stop for any serious lover of mid-century modern design must be a night at the Radisson SAS hotel, designed right down to the door handles by Arne Jacobsen. His Egg and Ant chairs adorn the lobby and restaurant, and even the cutlery in the restaurant, Alberto K, is the original style designed by Jacobsen for the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. In 1960, when it opened, it was the city’s first skyscraper, and today it remains totally faithful to the designer’s original vision.\r\nwww.copenhagen.radissonsas.com\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"432\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nHotel Fox, Jarmers Plads 3, Copenhagen V\r\nA haven for younger design lovers, Hotel Fox has 61 rooms, each individually designed by one of 21 international artists from the fields of graphic design, urban art and illustration. Whether you’re after a forest fantasy room filled with stuffed animals, a striking Manga design or a peaceful minimalist retreat, there’s a room at Hotel Fox to suit every taste.\r\nwww.hotelfox.dk\r\n\r\nWhat to See and Do:\r\nDansk Design Centre, HC Andersens Boulevard 27, Copenhagen V\r\nLocated right in the middle of town, the Danish Design Museum has an excellent permanent collection of Danish designer furniture and housewares, and regular traveling exhibitions. The on-site design store is almost a miniature exhibition in itself – only one where everything’s for sale. And if your itinerary doesn’t spare time for this stop, you can pick up design souvenirs through their internet store.\r\nwww.ddc.dk\r\n\r\nNormann Copenhagen\r\nTrianglen, Osterbrogade 70, 2100 Copenhagen\r\nContinuing the tradition of spirited, bright and simple Danish design, Normann Copenhagen enlists the hottest European designers to produce elegant, quirky and restrained pieces for every facet of living. The store, housed in an opulent former theatre is magnificently minimalist on the inside, with blazing white interiors providing the backdrop for clothing, furniture and homewares by everyone from Karim Rashid to Marcel Wanders. Marvel at the grandiose columns and sweeping arches that have been rendered in the purest snow-white, creating a retro-futuristic environment that has seen the company win several awards.\r\nwww.normann-copenhagen.com\r\n\r\nOrdrupgaard\r\nVilvordevej 110, DK-2920 Charlottenlund\r\nA short trip out of the city will take you to the Ordrupgaard Museum, where you can admire the sinuous lines of Zaha Hadid’s extension to the 90-year-old building. Although it is heavy on concrete and glass, the addition doesn’t look at all out of place in its park-like setting; in fact, it helps to integrate the existing building more seamlessly into the landscape. The new space doubled the museum’s previous floor area, and contains a foyer, restaurant, bar, conference facilities and additional exhibition space. The museum contains one of the most significant collections of French painting in northern Europe, as well as works from Danish artists. \r\nwww.ordrupgaard.dk\r\n\r\nWhere to Eat and Drink:\r\nFox Bar and Kitchen\r\nJarmers Plads 3, Copenhagen V\r\nIf you’re already staying at Hotel Fox, you’ll be pleased to know that one of the hottest nightspots in town is right downstairs. A haven for the young and the beautiful, the space is decorated in earth tones, with wooden chairs and the ubiquitous touches of moulded plastic. The kitchen and bar work closely together, matching cocktails (often using curious vodka infusions, such as fennel or rose petal) rather than wine with each of the Nordic-style dishes served from the kitchen.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"433\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nKong Hans\r\nVingaardsstraede 6, Copenhagen K\r\nThis traditional fine dining restaurant is housed in the city’s oldest building, with vaulted ceilings, heavy silverware, thick white tablecloths and a classic menu to match. The writer Hans Christian Andersen once lived in an apartment above the restaurant, and composed several of his fairytales there.\r\nwww.konghans.dk\r\n\r\nNoma\r\nStrandgade 93, 1401 Copenhagen K\r\nWith two Michelin stars standing testimony to the quality of the food, you can relax and enjoy the austere environment of this former whale blubber warehouse.

Between the rather depressing tales of Hamlet, The Little Mermaid and the Emperor with no clothes, Danish cultural history can come across as a little gloomy. Fortunately, the same austere spirit that produced Hans Christian Andersen’s morality tales also resulted in the clean, minimalist lines of the furniture designs of luminaries such as Arne Jacobsen, Hans Wegner and Verner Panton. Today, the country’s capital Copenhagen not only enjoys a reputation as one of the great historical design centres of Europe but is also currently undergoing a boom in modern architecture.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"431\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>Perhaps there’s some architectural competition going on between Copenhagen and its cross-harbour neighbour Malmo, in Sweden. While Malmo has enjoyed international attention thanks to Santiago Calatrava’s spectacular Turning Torso tower, Copenhagen has also recently commissioned a host of stunning buildings by famed architects. American Daniel Liebeskind’s Dansk Jødisk Museum (The Jewish Museum) was completed in 2004, and Iraqi-born Zaha Hadid designed the stunning new wing of the art museum Ordrupgaard, just north of Copenhagen, which opened in 2005. Norman Foster designed the new elephant house and enclosure in the Copenhagen Zoo (due to open this year), and Frenchman Jean Nouvel is behind the concert hall of the National Broadcasting Company (planned opening spring 2008). Danish architect Henning Larsen has also been busy, with his glorious new Opera House on the city’s harbourfront and the French wing of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek art museum, which is a masterpiece of light and space.</p>\n\n	<p>The highlight of Copenhagen’s architectural renaissance, however, is the new extension to the 19th century redbrick Royal Library. The granite and glass building, was first unofficially, and later formally nicknamed “The Black Diamond”, and teeters dramatically over the waterfront, its dark, faceted windows throwing spectacular reflections across the boardwalk. Completed in 1999, the building houses a concert hall, bookshop, café, exhibition space and the restaurant Soren K.</p>\n\n	<p>Where to Stay:<br />\nHotel Twentyseven, Løngangstræde 27, 1468 Copenhagen K <br />\nEnergetic and quirky, Hotel Twentyseven is situated in the heart of Copenhagen, just a few metres from the town square. The hotel prides itself on creating a design-savvy, seductive environment that is all about living an ‘uncomplicated life’. Visitors can book a unique Live Life-package, which allows them to sip wine in The Wine Room, experience food and wine from all over the world in the restaurant, enjoy a ‘molecular drink’ at the Honey Ryder Cocktail Lounge and get a cool experience in the exceptional Absolut Icebar Copenhagen, with ice from the Torne-river in Lapland. Extra points to them for having a cocktail bar named after a 007 film character.<br />\nwww.hotel27.dk</p>\n\n	<p>Radisson <span class=\"caps\">SAS</span>, Falkoner Alle 9, Copenhagen F<br />\nThe first stop for any serious lover of mid-century modern design must be a night at the Radisson <span class=\"caps\">SAS</span> hotel, designed right down to the door handles by Arne Jacobsen. His Egg and Ant chairs adorn the lobby and restaurant, and even the cutlery in the restaurant, Alberto K, is the original style designed by Jacobsen for the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. In 1960, when it opened, it was the city’s first skyscraper, and today it remains totally faithful to the designer’s original vision.<br />\nwww.copenhagen.radissonsas.com</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"432\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>Hotel Fox, Jarmers Plads 3, Copenhagen V<br />\nA haven for younger design lovers, Hotel Fox has 61 rooms, each individually designed by one of 21 international artists from the fields of graphic design, urban art and illustration. Whether you’re after a forest fantasy room filled with stuffed animals, a striking Manga design or a peaceful minimalist retreat, there’s a room at Hotel Fox to suit every taste.<br />\nwww.hotelfox.dk</p>\n\n	<p>What to See and Do:<br />\nDansk Design Centre, HC Andersens Boulevard 27, Copenhagen V<br />\nLocated right in the middle of town, the Danish Design Museum has an excellent permanent collection of Danish designer furniture and housewares, and regular traveling exhibitions. The on-site design store is almost a miniature exhibition in itself – only one where everything’s for sale. And if your itinerary doesn’t spare time for this stop, you can pick up design souvenirs through their internet store.<br />\nwww.ddc.dk</p>\n\n	<p>Normann Copenhagen<br />\nTrianglen, Osterbrogade 70, 2100 Copenhagen<br />\nContinuing the tradition of spirited, bright and simple Danish design, Normann Copenhagen enlists the hottest European designers to produce elegant, quirky and restrained pieces for every facet of living. The store, housed in an opulent former theatre is magnificently minimalist on the inside, with blazing white interiors providing the backdrop for clothing, furniture and homewares by everyone from Karim Rashid to Marcel Wanders. Marvel at the grandiose columns and sweeping arches that have been rendered in the purest snow-white, creating a retro-futuristic environment that has seen the company win several awards.<br />\nwww.normann-copenhagen.com</p>\n\n	<p>Ordrupgaard<br />\nVilvordevej 110, DK-2920 Charlottenlund<br />\nA short trip out of the city will take you to the Ordrupgaard Museum, where you can admire the sinuous lines of Zaha Hadid’s extension to the 90-year-old building. Although it is heavy on concrete and glass, the addition doesn’t look at all out of place in its park-like setting; in fact, it helps to integrate the existing building more seamlessly into the landscape. The new space doubled the museum’s previous floor area, and contains a foyer, restaurant, bar, conference facilities and additional exhibition space. The museum contains one of the most significant collections of French painting in northern Europe, as well as works from Danish artists. <br />\nwww.ordrupgaard.dk</p>\n\n	<p>Where to Eat and Drink:<br />\nFox Bar and Kitchen<br />\nJarmers Plads 3, Copenhagen V<br />\nIf you’re already staying at Hotel Fox, you’ll be pleased to know that one of the hottest nightspots in town is right downstairs. A haven for the young and the beautiful, the space is decorated in earth tones, with wooden chairs and the ubiquitous touches of moulded plastic. The kitchen and bar work closely together, matching cocktails (often using curious vodka infusions, such as fennel or rose petal) rather than wine with each of the Nordic-style dishes served from the kitchen.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"433\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>Kong Hans<br />\nVingaardsstraede 6, Copenhagen K<br />\nThis traditional fine dining restaurant is housed in the city’s oldest building, with vaulted ceilings, heavy silverware, thick white tablecloths and a classic menu to match. The writer Hans Christian Andersen once lived in an apartment above the restaurant, and composed several of his fairytales there.<br />\nwww.konghans.dk</p>\n\n	<p>Noma<br />\nStrandgade 93, 1401 Copenhagen K<br />\nWith two Michelin stars standing testimony to the quality of the food, you can relax and enjoy the austere environment of this former whale blubber warehouse. Subtle touches add warmth to the stripped back décor &#8211; low, glowing lights and animal skins draped over the smoked oak chairs. Restaurateur Claus Meyer and chef Rene Redzepi serve artistic, refined Nordic cuisine that is presented in an almost sculptural form.

The coolest design feature is the floating bowler hat lighting which Kate describes as ‘Magritte meets Clockwork Orange’. And because they know men love their music, Wayne Conway (who directed the design) made sure to hunt down some great vinyl and a vintage set of turntables so boys can help create the perfect environment while they shop! <br />\n&#62;&#62;Visit <a href=\"http://www.katesylvester.com\">www.katesylvester.com</a></p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n\n	<h4>Homage to Pan Yu Lin</h4>\n\n	<p><img src=\"/images/435.jpg\" class=\"imgleft\" title=\"Homage to Pan Yu Lin\" alt=\"Homage to Pan Yu Lin\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /> Christine Hafermalz-Wheeler, the Artist Goldsmith, is presenting her major collection of 2007 museum work at the Waiheke Island Community Art Gallery, Oneroa, over the Easter period.

Temperatures in the area drop to around 17 degrees Celcius in winter and reach highs of 30 in summer, but rain and humidity are always present. “We have sun in the morning and rain in the afternoon, which tends to prevent temperatures from soaring too high.” The overhang that juts out from the living room and kitchen over the decking protects the interior from the downpours, so the sliding windows can still be left open, even in the rain – the sounds of the dripping rainforest adding to the feeling of being amid nature.\r\n	\r\nThe four-bedroom home was built in 2005, and is situated just a two hour drive from San Paulo city, and although the site looks to have been carved out of thick bush, Casas says the land was already cleared when he purchased it. This meant he was able to position the home where he pleased without much excavation. Casas chose a sunny northern exposure, which was sheltered enough by the trees to provide some shade in summer.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"442\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n	\r\nThe fact that the home hones in on the bush led Casas to use a palette of all-natural and sustainable materials. The exterior cladding, decking and interior floors are all crafted from Cumara, an untreated, sustainable Brazilian hardwood that is an extremely durable for this climate, as it withstands heat and humidity without losing its natural colour, he explains. Glass and wood are the two main materials used throughout and the fact that the home is naturally ventilated and heated through the glass in winter means electricity bills are vastly reduced. \r\n	\r\nCasas’ favourite area of the house is the living room, which serves as the hub, opening onto the terrace, studio and kitchen on the lower level. “The intimate contact with nature is really felt in this room. At night we watch movies with the doors open and sometimes an owl or a bat flies into the living room. And in the day, birds flit in and out,” he recalls. While snakes and other nastier bugs also call the bush home, Casas says he hasn’t yet encountered any creature fierce or dangerous. \r\n	\r\nThe open plan nature of the home suits the lifestyle of the architect, his wife and daughter. “It’s comfortable and elegant, yet without pretension. The fact that it’s not too large also makes maintenance easier,” he says. Even so, every four weeks, Casas has someone come to the house to clean cobwebs and any other natural visitor tracks from the home. \r\n	\r\nSmooth indoor-outdoor living was a key goal for Casas, and the vast deck successfully enhances the feeling of the living room reaching the outer boundaries of the bush. Right on the edge of the verdant jungle, Casas designed a heated spa pool, which can be covered with a sliding section of decking when they are away. \r\n	\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"443\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the home’s design and the focus on nature led Casas to play down the interior decoration of the home, so not to overtake the beauty of the bush. In his studio, the large, simple square window without a sill, frames the lush flora like a living artwork. In the living room, Casas added vintage furniture, such as the brown leather Mathias Seiler seat that belonged to his grandmother in the ‘50s, to give the room a more laid back aesthetic. The hanging fireplace, which is based on a ‘60s design, gives the room a retro feel, and was sourced through American fireplace design company, Fireorb. The floating hearth has a suitable organic shape and because it doesn’t require a drywall, it could be placed anywhere in the room without occupying too much space. Casas also liked the fact that you can still huddle around the fireplace without the view being blocked; in fact you’re staring right at it. \r\n	\r\nAlthough when looking at the home front on, it looks to be all on one level, in fact there are three. The floor plan has good flow, says Casas and works well for his needs. In the basement level, there are storage areas, which remain naturally cool throughout the year, as well as a sauna room; on the living room level, there is an open plan kitchen, a housekeeper’s room and bathroom, and a studio and laundry; and on the top level, three bedrooms run off the central floating mezzanine.\r\n	\r\nThe simple box-like feel of the home adheres to the Brazilian architectural movement of the 1950s known as Paulist Brutalist architecture, which employed simple shapes and materials, used minimum resources, and where the design was thought through on the basis of the people occupying the home, rather than ornamentation. Casas says he has always been attracted to this period of 1950s Brazilian architecture. Despite references to fine Brazilian architecture of the past, Casas says his main inspiration was drawn from the environment he likes the most – the home of birds, trees and bats, the dripping green rooms of the Mata Atlântica.','	<p><txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>_Words Ginny Fisher<br />\nPhotography Tuca Reinés_</p>\n\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>To escape work pressure in the bustling Brazilian metropolis of San Paulo, Brazilian architect Arthur Casas likes to plant himself in the Atlantic bush for rejuvenation.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>Doors, or a lack of them, are a defining element of this south Brazilian holiday home, says the owner and architect Arthur Casas. “When I am in the living room, it’s like I am in the forest,” says Casas dreamily, from his San Paulo architectural office. “The idea was to integrate the house with the Mata Atlântica [Atlantic Bush].” To achieve this, the living room and central slab of the home were opened to the north and south via huge sliding glass doors that reach up to the second storey, also opening the mezzanine floor to the elements.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"441\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>As a result, the climate played a central role in Casa’s design. “It’s hot most of the year, so we had to think about ventilation, and just opening the doors creates enough of a through-draught that we don’t require air conditioning in the main living area.” In addition to the huge sliders, Casas used exterior wooden slats that can be opened to increase airflow throughout the home. </p>\n\n	<p>The moderate temperatures of southern Brazil are pretty similar to the sub-tropical north of New Zealand.

But as impressive as the soaring, cantilevered, grassed roof, sweeping main stair and gleaming curtain of windows are, it’s the parts you don’t immediately see that make the building really extraordinary.\r\n	\r\nApart from Scotland (the original home of golf), no country has more courses per capita than New Zealand, so creating something memorable was always going to take more than the Remarkable location of the course.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"445\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nFor inspiration, Patterson Associates turned to the practice’s driving concept: appurtuancy. It’s a slightly ungainly word that hides an elegant concept: ‘natural fit’, or inherent connection to the whole. And in this case, both logic and emotion dictated that the right solution for The Hills was a clubhouse that literally sank into the landscape of the course.\r\n\r\nMichael Hill came to the architecture studio with a one-line brief: he wanted people to leave the course reflecting not only on their golfing experience, but also on their experience of the clubhouse. “After long discussions with Michael, we discovered that this could be distilled down to the relationship between the design and the game of golf being played on the course,” Andrew Patterson explains. “Michael wanted the building to be an experience in its own right but not one that compromised or competed with the play. He wanted a design that amplified the experience of the course and vice versa.”\r\n	\r\nQueenstown is famous for its stringent rules restricting buildings from interfering with the area’s spectacular views. Working with course designer John Darby, Patterson narrowed down the possible sites for the clubhouse to just two that would meet the council and the course requirements. “Practicality meant that in order for the building to be easy to use, it should be located between the first and 18th fairways. There was no space between the first and the 18th, but there was some space around them. We narrowed it down to two sites – one had a really good view of Lake Hayes from the top of a hill, and the other was sunken down behind some trees. As good as the view of Lake Hayes was from the first site, it was the second that promised the strongest relationship to the golfing experience. People are there for the golf, You can get lovely views of Lake Hayes from all over the district. On the less obvious site, the whole building could form a grandstand over the 18th green, and give it a sense of theatre.”\r\n	\r\nAt its core, the game of golf is about the relationship of player, ball and landscape. and the site chosen places the clubhouse near the centre of the property, with the course spiraling in a clockwise direction around the building. But putting it in such a central position meant the integration of the 15,000 square foot building into the landscape was even more critical. Considering the possibilities, Pattersons hit on the idea of burying two-thirds of the building. “By placing the building largely underground, your eye just drifts over the building; there’s no extra node in the landscape,” says Patterson. “And so we were able to maintain the players’ and spectators’ enjoyment of the landscape, and maximize their enjoyment of the game. People tend to look at photos of the building and think it’s quite small, but it’s actually very big. It’s deeply underground.”\r\n	\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"446\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nPatterson Associates test any concept by its ability to make sense of a brief with an elegant and logical solution. For them, a beautiful concept solves multiple design challenges simply and simultaneously. For example, all the necessary excavating equipment was already right there on site. “Earthmoving is what golf course construction and design is all about,” says Patterson. “So it fitted with the concept to use the infrastructure that was already there.” Interring a large part of the building meant that the more prosaic aspects of golf course management – the storage and recharging systems for the golf carts, service areas and locker rooms – could all be neatly concealed alongside the subterranean colour therapy spa. Most golf clubhouses don’t include such extravagances, but as home to the New Zealand Open, The Hills has to cater to a small but discerning year-round membership, as well as a huge, international-level annual event. With no retail aspect, the main member spaces – the bar, restaurant, spa and locker rooms – feel more like a private home than a public space.\r\n\r\n“Usually the clubhouse is a private spectator box for small groups of people,” says Patterson. “And then the Open happens, and that grand stair and courtyard turns into the welcoming space for a village of Marques, which stretches up the 18thfairway above the building.”\r\n	\r\nThe clubhouse is built predominantly in glass-reinforced concrete and local river schist pre-cast aggregate, with double-glazed, frameless windows. Queenstown’s extreme temperature range mean the building needed to withstand both searing Central Otago summers, and snow-clad winters. Most of the work is done by the impressive suspended glass-reinforced concrete roof, under which the rest of the building is recessed. “In Queenstown, you can’t play golf over the three deepest months of winter” Patterson explains. “The roof is designed to carry a two-metre snowload; it weighs 60 tonnes, as much as a jumbo jet and it’s really a warm building because of the insulating characteristics of the roof.”\r\n	\r\nThe building also adheres to commendable standards for environment friendliness – although no New Zealand ‘green-star’ category currently exists for any buildings except office buildings, by international standards, the building is ‘five green star’ rated. “It’s all double-glazed and heated with bio-diesel,” says Patterson. “It’s self-sufficient and self-sustainable. All the sewage is processed on site, and the water comes out of the site. It all grows out of making the building part of the landscape. If you’re going to have a building that looks like it is part of the land, it kind of flows that rather than relying on introduced energy it should harness as much as possible, the energy embodied in that landscape.”\r\n	\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"447\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe interior of the building was also designed by Patterson Associates, with contributions from Michael Hill and his wife, Christine. The colour and material palette was keep minimal: sparkling schist walls and floors, wood-lined changing rooms, and black-and-white classic modernist furniture. A golf ball ‘dimple’ motif carries right through the building, featuring in ceiling and wall panels, as well as mirrors. Solid shapes, such at the bar, take what Patterson Associates describe as a “wedge” shape, continuing the golfing metaphor. Even the curving edge at the top of the main stair has a rounded shape reminiscent of the edge of a sand trap. In fact, the entire clubhouse is a bunker of sorts – unlike most clubhouses, this one is not ‘out of bounds’. If the ball strays onto the clubhouse you just play it from the roof.\r\n	\r\n“Seeing the building in operation as the VIP grandstand during last year’s New Zealand Open was a wonderful experience,” says Patterson. “It was the ‘organiser’ of the whole layout and that was very nice for our team. It was great to see the building working.” It’s another masterstroke for Patterson Associates, we say.\r\n\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>_Words Melinda Williams<br />\nPhotography Simon Devitt_</p>\n\n	<p></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Faced with a choice of hills on which to place a new golf clubhouse, Patterson Associates simply decided to put a hole in one.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>Cresting out from a rolling hillside, the clubhouse at the new Michael Hill-owned Hills Golf Course in Queenstown is a spectacular wedge of concrete and schist that morphs seamlessly into the landscape.

Most of the work is done by the impressive suspended glass-reinforced concrete roof, under which the rest of the building is recessed. “In Queenstown, you can’t play golf over the three deepest months of winter” Patterson explains. “The roof is designed to carry a two-metre snowload; it weighs 60 tonnes, as much as a jumbo jet and it’s really a warm building because of the insulating characteristics of the roof.”</p>\n\n	<p>The building also adheres to commendable standards for environment friendliness – although no New Zealand ‘green-star’ category currently exists for any buildings except office buildings, by international standards, the building is ‘five green star’ rated. “It’s all double-glazed and heated with bio-diesel,” says Patterson. “It’s self-sufficient and self-sustainable. All the sewage is processed on site, and the water comes out of the site. It all grows out of making the building part of the landscape. If you’re going to have a building that looks like it is part of the land, it kind of flows that rather than relying on introduced energy it should harness as much as possible, the energy embodied in that landscape.”</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"447\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>The interior of the building was also designed by Patterson Associates, with contributions from Michael Hill and his wife, Christine. The colour and material palette was keep minimal: sparkling schist walls and floors, wood-lined changing rooms, and black-and-white classic modernist furniture. A golf ball ‘dimple’ motif carries right through the building, featuring in ceiling and wall panels, as well as mirrors. Solid shapes, such at the bar, take what Patterson Associates describe as a “wedge” shape, continuing the golfing metaphor. Even the curving edge at the top of the main stair has a rounded shape reminiscent of the edge of a sand trap. In fact, the entire clubhouse is a bunker of sorts – unlike most clubhouses, this one is not ‘out of bounds’. If the ball strays onto the clubhouse you just play it from the roof.</p>\n\n	<p>“Seeing the building in operation as the <span class=\"caps\">VIP</span> grandstand during last year’s New Zealand Open was a wonderful experience,” says Patterson. “It was the ‘organiser’ of the whole layout and that was very nice for our team. It was great to see the building working.” It’s another masterstroke for Patterson Associates, we say.</p>\n\n','','','/images/444.jpg','mag-article','issue43',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','scenic-drive','','','','','','','','','','','268f04a16617cc557843c5a5d6aae2cc','2008-03-25'),(255,'2008-07-31 13:24:01','gabrielle.mirkin','2008-07-31 13:47:25','isaac.hindinmiller','Urbis - Milan Report 2008 - Issue 44 on sale now!','','!(imgright)/images/454.jpg!

We take a look at the results.*\r\n\r\nDesignday says it all. It’s a day for design. While in the pages of Urbis we can show you stunning designs, those pictures will still lack that tangible element where you are able to sit in the chairs or touch the fabrics. Designday is how we get design out of the pages of the magazine and into the real world. Designday visitors have the opportunity to see phenomenal creative concepts, dreamt up by nine of the country’s top fashion designers and exhibited in Auckland’s top design showrooms. Not only can guests then lounge on a Design Denmark chair or lean on the edge of a Poggenpohl kitchen but they are also immersed in the entertainment of design for a day. In recognition of winning the best installation by a fashion designer, Lucie Boshier, paired with Natuzzi, was presented with a stunning piece of jewellery by Orsini.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"677\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Apartmento/Crane Brothers*\r\nApartmento and Crane Brothers were a natural pairing. Both are New Zealand- owned-and-run design companies that focus on simple but perfectly proportioned forms. As designer Murray Crane explains: “It’s all about tailoring.”\r\nFor Designday, Crane Brothers created a makeshift workroom within the Apartmento store. A sewing machine, racks of fabric and an expert tailor, cutting and sewing, completed the scene. The architectural shapes of the brown paper patterns took on the look of exquisite paper artworks complementing the elegant screenprints on cloth hung about the space. Crane’s concept was to allow “the sleekness and minimalism of Apartmento to be transformed with images of ‘the workroom’ and ‘factory’.”\r\nThe elegant, layered installation made a big impression on Designday judge Tim Walker. “A marvellous match. A carefully considered synergy made for a space charged with a very material sense of tonality, bespoke intrigue and a confident ease. The fact the guys were on hand, with the patterns, paraphernalia and magic of ‘making’ was a fine touch.”\r\ninto getting it just so.\r\n \r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"681\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Coast/Emma Kate Bamford*\r\nOnce Designday vistors reached Coast, they didn’t go anywhere for a while. The showroom which specialises in outdoor furniture was decked out with sand, tropical plants and given a design makeover that transformed this space into a beach house. It’s effect was pronounced, visitors quickly settled into the oversized beanbags and loungers, eased their sandals off their feet and wiggled their toes into the sand and relaxed. The ‘Coast Island Cocktail’ put on by 42 Below also helped in taking the edge off. In no time, everyone was on island time.  \r\nThis installation was in some ways more subtle than some of the others as there wasn’t such an obvious sculptural insertion but Urbis editor and Designday judge Nicole Stock explains: “Emma Kate’s installation may seem subtle to a visitor who hasn’t been here before, but to anyone who has previously visited the shop, the difference is remarkable. The casual New Zealand bach has been seamlessly incorporated into Coast’s compact urban space.”\r\nDesignday judge Tim Walker summed it up simply by saying, “Cool, coherent, totally convincing space.”  \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"673\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*The Westin/Zambesi*\r\nThe Westin Hotel was the only Designday venue that wasn’t strictly a design showroom. Its design credentials were obvious however with its stunning architectural design by Peddle Thorp with interiors by Martin Hughes. \r\nThe Westin sits alongside the water in Auckland’s Viaduct and Zambesi took this theme to heart when they designed their installation. Zambesi chose to step outside of the central lounge that was the proposed site for their installation, and instead spilled a catwalk of masked mannequins out into the central pool. The faintly rippling water wet the trouser legs and further drew attention to the  layered textures in this installation.\r\nThe spare and elegant installation shows that you don’t need multitudes of complicated elements to get a complex idea across. Rather, this was an experiment in minimalism and it proved that less can indeed be more. Designday judge Tim Walker commented: “Inspired choice of venue and a suitably spare installation. Intriguing; did the various degrees of wetness imply some degree of narrative, left unclear? There was no soundtrack but a strong sense of a score nonetheless. The floating signage, which seemed to navigate itself over the full expanse of the pond, was a deft touch.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"682\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Design Denmark/Lonely Hearts*\r\nLonely Hearts roared into the Design Denmark showroom in Ponsonby with their installation of “a day at the motocross”. The best of Scandinavian Furniture and accessories collided with the youthful enthusiasm of the Lonely Hearts design team with this grunty, adrenaline-fuelled installation.As Lonely Hearts explained before the event, “Night transcends day as the showroom gets blacked out in favour of LCD lights in beanbags, and the brightness of the new Lonely Hearts sportswear range of protective clothing. Smoke machines, mannequins lining the window and an energy-filled atmosphere will leave guests feeling like they just walked out of a highly fashionable speedway.” \r\n The mannequins were posed on motocross bikes and as biking fans, with the atmosphere created with the smoke machine and the lighting, so the installation seemed both charged with energy and \r\neerily still. Design Denmark furniture, products and lighting were used to great effect in the installation building up a motocross landscape despite being refined, generally interior-based Scandinavian designs. An interesting contrast was created between rough-and-ready and sleek subtlety.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"680\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Poggenpohl/Huffer*\r\nOne of the more perplexing (but incredibly enjoyable) installations was Huffer’s Free the Fish campaign at Poggenpohl. \r\nPoggenpohl’s sleek and functional minimalist kitchens were contrasted with ocean imagery set in antique frames that gave the entire space loads of personality. Before you even entered the showroom, visitors were bombarded with ‘protesters’ waving neon ‘free the fish’ placards. \r\nPoggenpohl’s recently launched Porsche kitchen, complete with flat-screen TVs embedded in the workstation walls were utilised by Huffer to show their ‘free the fish’ fashion show. Before the Day, Huffer designer Dan Buckley said, “Expect fishy dishes, loud music, and lots of energy. Get wacky and free your own ‘inner fish’.” Tim Walker, Designday judge, was taken with this energy and proclaimed this a “cool brand/design exercise”. Adding that, “The ‘protest’ placards outside announced the manifesto-like theme immediately on arrival. A simple but emphatic ‘free your inner fish’ Huffer presence in Poggenpohl-land. Distinctive and fresh.” We’re not sure you could say the same about the large tuna displayed on ice throughout the day, though. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"695\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Matisse & Kouzina/Karen Walker*\r\nKaren Walker has become one of New Zealand’s most recognisable, and coveted, fashion brands. Her range has since spilled out beyond the boundaries of clothing into jewellery, sunglasses and a range of soft hues for Resene paints. Her connection with interiors, then, is strong and her installation concept, designed by Katie Lockhart, embraced this side of the Karen Walker brand. As they were pairing with Matisse kitchen company Kouzina, kitchen utensils were painted with the Karen Walker Resene new range of colours which emphasised their graphic forms. This sense of colourful whimsy continued outside with an Alice in Wonderland-esque garden bar complete with a pot chair from Matisse.  \r\nDesignday judge Tim Walker had this to say: “A very complete, elegant and highly articulated scheme ranging across the garden, entrance gallery and showroom. The decison to focus on Karen Walker’s Resene range, and coupling that palette to kitchen domestic items was a great way of connecting the brand(s) with Matisse’s, even if the fashion was missed.” \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"678\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Inovo/Jaeha*\r\nJaeha and Inovo’s concept centred around the thought of “what would extraordinary people do in their private time?” The private sphere of people’s lives was wrenched open as mannequins depicted scenes from real life, scenes that happen only behind closed doors. The often provocative and  always humorous displays were scattered throughout the large showroom creating a sense of discovery as you wandered through the showroom – one in the midst of a line of toilets, another in a glass shower. Kim Crawford wine was served throughout the day as Designday guests peeked at mannequin girls getting ready for a big night out, or a couple’s dynamics in the home. Judge Tim Walker noted, “A strong sense of a coherent narrative linking the tableaux through the shop... Extraordinary textiles and fashion, inserted with an insistent and consistent sense of theatre through the Inovo showroom.” (Perhaps more soap opera than Shakespeare.) What Nicole Stock, Urbis editor, particularly liked was the “contrast between the rich and textural fabrics alongside the smooth and shiny surfaces of basins and tapware”.    \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"674\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Cite/World*\r\nThe affinity between Cite and World is obvious. Not only do both design companies have a focus on inventive forms and colour, but Francis Hooper, designer of World, collects the Vitra models that Cite stocks. \r\nThe title of World and Cite’s installation was Transformation. As Hooper explains, “We transformed everything on the day, from products, chairs, lights, clothing, objects and the space itself into one silver factory space that could be used (sat on, worn and enjoyed) or just looked at as a beautiful space.” He goes on to explain that they wanted to “show shape and form in its purest way and show how we react to objects that are the same but now are different”. Designday judge Tim Walker noted, “Good, simple, bold idea beautifully realised. Signage in silver on window and the largely empty silver cube (with 3 or 4 silver World shirts on a hanging rack) provided a dramatic reinforcement of World’s ‘Factory of ideas and Experience’ credo, ‘framing’ the Cite environment at the rear of store.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"679\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Natuzzi/Lucie Boshier Couture*\r\nThe 1930s Cotton Club was brought alive in the installation created by Lucie Boshier and Natuzzi. The prohibition club was always a place of mystery and exclusiveness and Boshier brought this into the 21st century by blacking out the entire Natuzzi showroom with a side door as the only entrance. Outside scantily dressed flapper girls let visitors in, first to an anteroom where XX and her dog XX filled out your ‘prescription’ before allowing you into the showroom. Live music, Marmalade Spiced Chai gin cocktails served in true prohibition fashion from a teapot into tea cups, and fully kitted-out actors made the installation a complete, immersive experience. Designday judge, Tim Walker, said, “A total sensory narrative experience. Seamless. Completely coherent effort showing huge attention to detail and ‘character’. The production effortlessly transformed the showroom.” Judging partner Nicole Stock said, “Everything was thought of and considered from details like matchboxess to the entire store being blacked out and transformed. Actors, music, props all created a dramatic atmosphere. It had everything.” Diamond Dance Entertainment, Mod’s Hair, and Phoenix Cosmetics were all instrumental to pulling together this installation.','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\nPhotography Nic Staveley<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Nine of New Zealand’s top fashion designers collaborate with leading Auckland design showrooms to create unforgettable installations. We take a look at the results.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>Designday says it all. It’s a day for design. While in the pages of Urbis we can show you stunning designs, those pictures will still lack that tangible element where you are able to sit in the chairs or touch the fabrics. Designday is how we get design out of the pages of the magazine and into the real world. Designday visitors have the opportunity to see phenomenal creative concepts, dreamt up by nine of the country’s top fashion designers and exhibited in Auckland’s top design showrooms. Not only can guests then lounge on a Design Denmark chair or lean on the edge of a Poggenpohl kitchen but they are also immersed in the entertainment of design for a day. In recognition of winning the best installation by a fashion designer, Lucie Boshier, paired with Natuzzi, was presented with a stunning piece of jewellery by Orsini.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"677\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Apartmento/Crane Brothers</strong><br />\nApartmento and Crane Brothers were a natural pairing. Both are New Zealand- owned-and-run design companies that focus on simple but perfectly proportioned forms. As designer Murray Crane explains: “It’s all about tailoring.”<br />\nFor Designday, Crane Brothers created a makeshift workroom within the Apartmento store. A sewing machine, racks of fabric and an expert tailor, cutting and sewing, completed the scene. The architectural shapes of the brown paper patterns took on the look of exquisite paper artworks complementing the elegant screenprints on cloth hung about the space. Crane’s concept was to allow “the sleekness and minimalism of Apartmento to be transformed with images of ‘the workroom’ and ‘factory’.”<br />\nThe elegant, layered installation made a big impression on Designday judge Tim Walker. “A marvellous match. A carefully considered synergy made for a space charged with a very material sense of tonality, bespoke intrigue and a confident ease. The fact the guys were on hand, with the patterns, paraphernalia and magic of ‘making’ was a fine touch.”<br />\ninto getting it just so.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"681\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Coast/Emma Kate Bamford</strong><br />\nOnce Designday vistors reached Coast, they didn’t go anywhere for a while. The showroom which specialises in outdoor furniture was decked out with sand, tropical plants and given a design makeover that transformed this space into a beach house. It’s effect was pronounced, visitors quickly settled into the oversized beanbags and loungers, eased their sandals off their feet and wiggled their toes into the sand and relaxed. The ‘Coast Island Cocktail’ put on by 42 Below also helped in taking the edge off. In no time, everyone was on island time.  <br />\nThis installation was in some ways more subtle than some of the others as there wasn’t such an obvious sculptural insertion but Urbis editor and Designday judge Nicole Stock explains: “Emma Kate’s installation may seem subtle to a visitor who hasn’t been here before, but to anyone who has previously visited the shop, the difference is remarkable. The casual New Zealand bach has been seamlessly incorporated into Coast’s compact urban space.”<br />\nDesignday judge Tim Walker summed it up simply by saying, “Cool, coherent, totally convincing space.”  </p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"673\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>The Westin/Zambesi</strong><br />\nThe Westin Hotel was the only Designday venue that wasn’t strictly a design showroom. Its design credentials were obvious however with its stunning architectural design by Peddle Thorp with interiors by Martin Hughes. <br />\nThe Westin sits alongside the water in Auckland’s Viaduct and Zambesi took this theme to heart when they designed their installation. Zambesi chose to step outside of the central lounge that was the proposed site for their installation, and instead spilled a catwalk of masked mannequins out into the central pool. The faintly rippling water wet the trouser legs and further drew attention to the  layered textures in this installation.<br />\nThe spare and elegant installation shows that you don’t need multitudes of complicated elements to get a complex idea across. Rather, this was an experiment in minimalism and it proved that less can indeed be more. Designday judge Tim Walker commented: “Inspired choice of venue and a suitably spare installation. Intriguing; did the various degrees of wetness imply some degree of narrative, left unclear? There was no soundtrack but a strong sense of a score nonetheless. The floating signage, which seemed to navigate itself over the full expanse of the pond, was a deft touch.”</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"682\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Design Denmark/Lonely Hearts</strong><br />\nLonely Hearts roared into the Design Denmark showroom in Ponsonby with their installation of “a day at the motocross”. The best of Scandinavian Furniture and accessories collided with the youthful enthusiasm of the Lonely Hearts design team with this grunty, adrenaline-fuelled installation.As Lonely Hearts explained before the event, “Night transcends day as the showroom gets blacked out in favour of <span class=\"caps\">LCD</span> lights in beanbags, and the brightness of the new Lonely Hearts sportswear range of protective clothing. Smoke machines, mannequins lining the window and an energy-filled atmosphere will leave guests feeling like they just walked out of a highly fashionable speedway.” \n The mannequins were posed on motocross bikes and as biking fans, with the atmosphere created with the smoke machine and the lighting, so the installation seemed both charged with energy and <br />\neerily still. Design Denmark furniture, products and lighting were used to great effect in the installation building up a motocross landscape despite being refined, generally interior-based Scandinavian designs. An interesting contrast was created between rough-and-ready and sleek subtlety.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"680\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Poggenpohl/Huffer</strong><br />\nOne of the more perplexing (but incredibly enjoyable) installations was Huffer’s Free the Fish campaign at Poggenpohl. <br />\nPoggenpohl’s sleek and functional minimalist kitchens were contrasted with ocean imagery set in antique frames that gave the entire space loads of personality. Before you even entered the showroom, visitors were bombarded with ‘protesters’ waving neon ‘free the fish’ placards. <br />\nPoggenpohl’s recently launched Porsche kitchen, complete with flat-screen TVs embedded in the workstation walls were utilised by Huffer to show their ‘free the fish’ fashion show. Before the Day, Huffer designer Dan Buckley said, “Expect fishy dishes, loud music, and lots of energy. Get wacky and free your own ‘inner fish’.” Tim Walker, Designday judge, was taken with this energy and proclaimed this a “cool brand/design exercise”. Adding that, “The ‘protest’ placards outside announced the manifesto-like theme immediately on arrival. A simple but emphatic ‘free your inner fish’ Huffer presence in Poggenpohl-land. Distinctive and fresh.” We’re not sure you could say the same about the large tuna displayed on ice throughout the day, though. </p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"695\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Matisse &amp; Kouzina/Karen Walker</strong><br />\nKaren Walker has become one of New Zealand’s most recognisable, and coveted, fashion brands. Her range has since spilled out beyond the boundaries of clothing into jewellery, sunglasses and a range of soft hues for Resene paints. Her connection with interiors, then, is strong and her installation concept, designed by Katie Lockhart, embraced this side of the Karen Walker brand. As they were pairing with Matisse kitchen company Kouzina, kitchen utensils were painted with the Karen Walker Resene new range of colours which emphasised their graphic forms. This sense of colourful whimsy continued outside with an Alice in Wonderland-esque garden bar complete with a pot chair from Matisse.  <br />\nDesignday judge Tim Walker had this to say: “A very complete, elegant and highly articulated scheme ranging across the garden, entrance gallery and showroom. The decison to focus on Karen Walker’s Resene range, and coupling that palette to kitchen domestic items was a great way of connecting the brand(s) with Matisse’s, even if the fashion was missed.” </p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"678\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Inovo/Jaeha</strong><br />\nJaeha and Inovo’s concept centred around the thought of “what would extraordinary people do in their private time?” The private sphere of people’s lives was wrenched open as mannequins depicted scenes from real life, scenes that happen only behind closed doors.

Some say it rotates. Others imagine all sorts of fantastical scenarios. Hidden in the middle of a pine and oak forest in the Perche region, some 90 minutes to the southwest of Paris, an extraordinary reinforced concrete structure looks out over an undulating, 13-hectare park. The space-like vessel was built between 1973 and 1976 – a period when all sorts of crazy architecture were still allowed in France. It was the brainchild of the son of a local entrepreneur, who spent time in Sausalito, California, and came back with a batch of photos and a multitude of mental images. For him, the house of his dreams would be based on the futuristic American architecture of the 1950s and 1960s.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"471\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe house may well look like a flying saucer that has landed at the heart of a Normandy copse. Yet, it is nevertheless also a wonderfully practical retreat, spread over three separate levels. The lowest is home to a large garage, a bedroom, a sauna and a stupendous swimming pool. On the ground floor, a sparsely furnished hall leads to three ensuite bedrooms and a billiard room, which are laid out like satellites clinging to the Earth. On top of that sits a large reception room, incorporating a kitchen, dining room and sitting area, which appears almost to be suspended in mid-air. The three levels are linked by two great spiral staircases, which form the backbone of this extraterrestrial “creature”. \r\n\r\nA keen fishing fan, the original owner created a huge lake to complement the house, which has now shrunk to only a fifth of its initial size. The level of the water was supposed to coincide with that of the terrace, but nature had different ideas and over the years, the lake has seeped back from the construction. As for the current owner, he actually started out looking for something quite different – a rather classical 19th century country house to act as a counterpoint to his modern Parisian loft. He dreamed of a charming manor lost in the middle of the countryside. Instead, he had a coup de foudre (was lovestruck) upon seeing this architectural wonder and gave carte blanche to French decorator Emmanuel Renoird to rework the interiors. Renoird first thought of creating a contemporary décor—“something very pared-down, with simple, noble materials”, he explains. But, little by little, the unusual spirit of the house took hold of him and led him to invent a sort of retro-futuristic vocabulary, perfectly in synch with the dreams and extravagance of the building’s first owner.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you step inside, you enter the fourth dimension. The brown carpet in the hallway has been replaced by a white resin floor. The original ceiling, covered with red stretched jersey wool, has been pierced with large oval Perspex windows, which allow a glimpse of the sky. On the left, a white vinyl sofa (probably a prototype for a Lotto ad from the 1980s) lights up from inside and gives off a yellowish glow. Above it, Renoird has assembled four Verner Panton aluminium lamps to form a large wall sconce. One of the staircases, meanwhile, has been wrapped in brown Vallauris cement tiles.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"472\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThat staircase leads up to the main reception room, where light flows in from all sides. Initially, the kitchen was enclosed, but today, it has been fitted out with several different blocks, which create a sense of conviviality. As for the dining room, it is equipped with a 1960s Italian stainless steel and glass table, as well as Eero Saarinen’s iconic Tulip chairs. More unusual is the Auguston Brisson painting placed on the floor. “One day”, recounts Renoird, “an auctioneer called me and told me, ‘I have something for you’. This painting is by the guy who created the backdrop for the French TV news in the 1980s. Its colours and forms vary according to the ambient sound, forming a kind of kaleidoscope”.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end, the living room is fitted with a huge bay window, which offers a sweeping view of the artificial lake.

Some say it rotates. Others imagine all sorts of fantastical scenarios. Hidden in the middle of a pine and oak forest in the Perche region, some 90 minutes to the southwest of Paris, an extraordinary reinforced concrete structure looks out over an undulating, 13-hectare park. The space-like vessel was built between 1973 and 1976 – a period when all sorts of crazy architecture were still allowed in France. It was the brainchild of the son of a local entrepreneur, who spent time in Sausalito, California, and came back with a batch of photos and a multitude of mental images. For him, the house of his dreams would be based on the futuristic American architecture of the 1950s and 1960s.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"471\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>The house may well look like a flying saucer that has landed at the heart of a Normandy copse. Yet, it is nevertheless also a wonderfully practical retreat, spread over three separate levels. The lowest is home to a large garage, a bedroom, a sauna and a stupendous swimming pool. On the ground floor, a sparsely furnished hall leads to three ensuite bedrooms and a billiard room, which are laid out like satellites clinging to the Earth. On top of that sits a large reception room, incorporating a kitchen, dining room and sitting area, which appears almost to be suspended in mid-air. The three levels are linked by two great spiral staircases, which form the backbone of this extraterrestrial “creature”. </p>\n\n	<p>A keen fishing fan, the original owner created a huge lake to complement the house, which has now shrunk to only a fifth of its initial size. The level of the water was supposed to coincide with that of the terrace, but nature had different ideas and over the years, the lake has seeped back from the construction. As for the current owner, he actually started out looking for something quite different – a rather classical 19th century country house to act as a counterpoint to his modern Parisian loft. He dreamed of a charming manor lost in the middle of the countryside. Instead, he had a coup de foudre (was lovestruck) upon seeing this architectural wonder and gave carte blanche to French decorator Emmanuel Renoird to rework the interiors. Renoird first thought of creating a contemporary décor—“something very pared-down, with simple, noble materials”, he explains. But, little by little, the unusual spirit of the house took hold of him and led him to invent a sort of retro-futuristic vocabulary, perfectly in synch with the dreams and extravagance of the building’s first owner.</p>\n\n	<p>As soon as you step inside, you enter the fourth dimension. The brown carpet in the hallway has been replaced by a white resin floor. The original ceiling, covered with red stretched jersey wool, has been pierced with large oval Perspex windows, which allow a glimpse of the sky. On the left, a white vinyl sofa (probably a prototype for a Lotto ad from the 1980s) lights up from inside and gives off a yellowish glow. Above it, Renoird has assembled four Verner Panton aluminium lamps to form a large wall sconce. One of the staircases, meanwhile, has been wrapped in brown Vallauris cement tiles.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"472\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>That staircase leads up to the main reception room, where light flows in from all sides. Initially, the kitchen was enclosed, but today, it has been fitted out with several different blocks, which create a sense of conviviality. As for the dining room, it is equipped with a 1960s Italian stainless steel and glass table, as well as Eero Saarinen’s iconic Tulip chairs. More unusual is the Auguston Brisson painting placed on the floor. “One day”, recounts Renoird, “an auctioneer called me and told me, ‘I have something for you’. This painting is by the guy who created the backdrop for the French TV news in the 1980s. Its colours and forms vary according to the ambient sound, forming a kind of kaleidoscope”.</p>\n\n	<p>At the opposite end, the living room is fitted with a huge bay window, which offers a sweeping view of the artificial lake. Only the furniture brings a few touches of colour to this otherwise immaculate space. The red of the Alfa sofa from Zanotta contrasts with the yellow of two 1970s armchairs. Above them, Renoird kept the original ceiling, made from strips of wood in the form of a wave, which is lit with primary colours.

Architect Tim Dorrington recalls the day when a couple, who he had been working on a renovation scheme for, called him to come and see another property that they were thinking of buying instead. The house in Herne Bay was “a fairly nice bungalow but it had had quite a lot of different things done to it over the years that weren’t particularly nice,” he says. “It seemed like there were a lot of mistakes that we would have to take out first, and the whole house was oriented the wrong way. The living room was in the southern corner of the house.” Despite Dorrington expressing misgivings, his clients merrily decided to trade in the Freeman’s Bay house he was working on, and start afresh with a scheme for the Herne Bay property, which involved juxtaposing a modern, contemporary ‘box’ onto the existing old bungalow. “Well, there’s always something you can do!” he shrugs, philosophically.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"474\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nIt took a lot of internal “jiggery-pokery” to make the various spaces of the house work, says Dorrington. “North is where north is, and the house is where the house is, and you can’t change those things.” There wasn’t much room between the front of the house and the northern boundary, but in order to make the living ‘heart’ of the house as big as possible for the couple and their two children, Dorrington decided to push the front of the house out further, and turn the front yard into a concreted courtyard. “Mainly, we changed around the public and private rooms. The original house had a kitchen and dining in the front but they only had one bedroom, and the rest of the house was for entertaining. We made it more of a family home. It’s three bedrooms upstairs now, and they’re at the back of the house, where it’s quieter and darker. We reintroduced the Victorian planning idea of having all the public rooms at the front and the private rooms at the back.”\r\n\r\nFrom the front, the house is now almost unrecognisable, with a modern, rectilinear concrete profile. A tall gate in the property’s fence opens to a path that leads past the main courtyard space to the left, to the solid pivot front door. It’s hard to imagine that this clean, concrete space with ficus creeping up the walls was once overgrown with bamboo and ivy. “It was pretty skoady,” says Dorrington. It was just a bricked courtyard with a wrap-around verandah, because the main room was a lot smaller, probably a third of the size it is now. It was very overgrown with bamboo and ivy and there was a water feature, like a trough.” To give the living area as much space as possible, Dorrington had the courtyard cleared right to the boundary wall, and added interest in the form of vertical layering – “the concrete wall with the ficus growing up it, then the planter behind it, and then the timber fence behind that.” He also had the level of the courtyard brought up to exactly the same level as the internal flooring, to ease the distinction between indoors and out and allow a table or sofa to straddle the threshold between the courtyard and living room evenly. Floor to ceiling framed cedar sliding doors give the living area a sense of lightness, and can be pushed toward either side, depending on how the indoor/outdoor space is being used.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"475\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe kitchen/living space is open and airy, with light pouring in through a large, frameless window at one end of the kitchen set centrally to the kitchen island. “It leads your eye out to the big window and the greenery outside, and the lushness of that,” Dorrington explains. “We were trying to create a garden room. Material-wise, we wanted the whole back wall of the kitchen to be panels of white, with as much of the kitchen as we could get away with being hidden. And everything is, except for the cooking bay \r\nitself – the fridge, the pantry, and a secret door into the laundry.”\r\n\r\nAcross the wide central entrance hall is the lounge/media room; a warm space with a gridded wall of shelving, which will house a projector that screens television and films on the large blind that pulls down over the main north-facing window. “The idea is that it’s a smaller room, more of a cosy space, with the timber floor and the dark liquorice wallpaper,” says Dorrington. “The other room is more of a family room, with more rugged floors.” \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"476\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe central corridor that divides the rooms was a key focus of the renovation. “All the rooms come off that corridor and it had really nice floorboards that we wanted to maintain. We also wanted to maintain the central front door.” To create a sense of entry, Dorrington chose a solid leaf pivot door, and extended the entrance walls just far enough to give some privacy, yet still allow the living space to flow across the corridor. “Seeing how that entry straddles the living area and getting the comfort it does was very satisfying,” Dorrington acknowledges. “If someone comes to knock on the door and you open it to talk to them, they’re not looking straight into the private zone. But the most satisfying thing was seeing it all come together. It was a little bit scary putting a contemporary box onto an old house. It definitely has two faces to it – you see it from the front and it’s a contemporary house but from the back you can’t see any of that – it’s a pretty traditional bungalow.” We don’t doubt the clients feel they’ve got the best of both worlds in their home.','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\n_Words Melinda Williams<br />\nPhotography Emma-Jane Hetherington_<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Sensitive planning made this Auckland bungalow renovation into a home that enjoys the best of old and new.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>You know you’ve found a good architect when he advises you against buying a particular do-up property, you ignore his advice completely and buy the house anyway, and he still manages to transform it into a beautifully livable space.

Motivated by the lack of “anything particularly exciting in the global resort space”, Hingarae Developments set out to create a resort with design and architecture as key components. Due for completion mid-next year, the resort’s architecture was inspired by 1960s airports, sci-fi pop culture, and the optimism that existed in the middle of last century before the move to a more imposing austere Cold War-era architecture. According to company spokesman Greg Hickman, “Hingarae is where we believe things should have evolved had the trends of the ‘50s and ‘60s not been interrupted by this far more sombre and purely functional form of architecture.”\r\n\r\nSet in remote native bush 40 minutes out of Taupo, Hingarae consists of one main building, the Central Hub, 28 self-contained houses or modules, a recreation hub with tennis courts, driving range and a health and well-being spa. The Central Hub contains a heliport, two bars (one underground), a restaurant, hotel and electric vehicle station, all available to temporary guests and permanent owners. “I’d say the Central Hub is a pretty amazing facility with a level of luxury wrapped in remarkable design and sense of presence that has not been seen in New Zealand yet,” enthuses Hickman. “In general, the development offers a level of luxury across all facilities and a design experience that is well beyond current NZ offerings and is truly world-leading.”\r\n\r\nThe Hingarae’s architecture will differentiate it from other local resorts. “The idea was to fuse living environments of the future with this remote and ancient land,” states Hickman. “The architectural intention is that the buildings remain timeless in their futuristic vision, so they will continue to appear progressive and visionary long into the future.” A testament to this futuristic vision is a new architectural concept where the roof, walls and floor of each building work as a continuous skin, with no sharp corners. This feature is inspired by the way nature designs and builds, yet still allows the resort to stand out from its surroundings. The interior spaces are characterised by curved walls, ‘floating’ floors and indirect, ambient LED lighting.\r\n\r\nHingarae will also employ innovative sustainable materials in its design. The superstructure will be executed in seamless composite panels extending from the walls and merging into roofs. Windows fit within openings created by folded composite panels, ensuring structural continuity. \r\n\r\nIt would be worth visiting Hingarae simply to see the Central Hub. Located on the northernmost ridge of the property, the Hub affords expansive views of Lake Taupo, mountains and the resort’s impressive sculpture garden. After arriving from the air by helicopter or through the valley by car, you’ll enter the Hub to find the reception area, and the resort’s superb bar and restaurant, an intimate movie theatre, and a late-night underground club. From there residents can descend via passenger lift to the vehicle dock, where electric cars are ready to take them to their modules. Visitors can head to Hotel Hingarae, where 11 ultra-luxurious suites cater to the fussiest of customers. At a cool $2.7 million each, the modules will appeal to a certain type of consumer – super wealthy, with a Jetsons obsession. And they’d better get in quick; word is they’re flying out the door.

Located on the northernmost ridge of the property, the Hub affords expansive views of Lake Taupo, mountains and the resort’s impressive sculpture garden. After arriving from the air by helicopter or through the valley by car, you’ll enter the Hub to find the reception area, and the resort’s superb bar and restaurant, an intimate movie theatre, and a late-night underground club. From there residents can descend via passenger lift to the vehicle dock, where electric cars are ready to take them to their modules. Visitors can head to Hotel Hingarae, where 11 ultra-luxurious suites cater to the fussiest of customers. At a cool $2.7 million each, the modules will appeal to a certain type of consumer – super wealthy, with a Jetsons obsession. And they’d better get in quick; word is they’re flying out the door. <span class=\"caps\">IHM</span></p>','','','/images/478t.jpg','mag-dispatch','issue44',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','future-perfect','','','','','','','','','','','a1690999142dc72ec6d5021587284d76','2008-07-19'),(272,'2008-07-31 13:47:29','isaac.hindinmiller','2009-09-29 09:52:21','andre.kini','Urbis - 10th Anniversary Edition - Issue 45 on sale now!','','!(imgright)/images/493.jpg!

Surrounded by trees, keeping a high watch over the landscape, and made of raw, natural materials, the mountain cabin houses hardy, pioneering, contemplative sorts: monks, woodsmen, nature-lovers. Of course, this mountain retreat, hidden in the Central Otago hills, is, in reality, only half an hour’s drive from the bright lights, crowded bars and adventure sports of Queenstown. But through clever use of siting and local materials, Fearon Hay have designed a modern cabin that feels like it is miles from civilisation, and carved out of the side of a mountain.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"497\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe approach to the cabin gives little clue to its existence. After climbing a steep road and descending a driveway, you eventually come to a flattened, gravelled platform jutting out from the side of the hill. “It’s almost like those switchbacks in European mountain roads, those places where you can stand and look out at the view,” explains architect Tim Hay. “That’s how we imagined it, and that’s how you arrive. You’re on a kind of terrace and you don’t really know there’s a building there. The only thing that gives it away is the handrail and the fireplace flue sticking up. The idea of discovering the building is there is cool.” On closer inspection, a small flight of stairs cuts into the platform, and as you descend them, you discover your arrival point was, in fact, the roof of a compact, two-bedroom cliffside cabin.\r\n\r\nInside, the house has the solid feel of a bunker, or even a cave carved out of the side of the hill. “It’s grunty,” Fearon puts it, succinctly. “For the exterior, we used heavily plastered schist, which gives the building a lot of solidity.” It also tonally blends the building into the hillside, a type of camouflage helped by the scree slope of crushed stones that falls away from the lower lip of the cabin. “We sited the cabin off the edge of the site rather than in the middle of it, which means that it’s quite discreet and when you’re down there, you feel quite secluded,” Fearon says. “It’s providing a ledge from which you can look out through the beech trees and over the landscape.” The house, as with much property in Queenstown, looks south, towards the lake and the mountains under the constantly shifting play of the sun.\r\nThe cabin is laid out simply: two bedrooms – the master room and a bunkroom – a bathroom, where the bath and shower can be closed off from the toilet and basin, and a living space encompassing kitchen and lounge. A sliding, cedar dividing wall along the horizontal axis of the space allows the bathroom and master bedroom to be screened off. “You can live with the whole thing open like a big studio or you can have a number of people in there. If you want to, you can lie in the bath and look out at the view,” says Fearon.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"499\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe interior of the cabin is classic Fearon Hay – sand-blasted precast concrete slab walls, concrete floor and a plastered ceiling to give a homogenous finish. “You end up with the feeling that the whole thing has been carved out of concrete.” The bath and benchtops are black basalt, and blackened steel panels in the kitchen match the window framing. Black metallic glass used for the shower panelling enhances the dark, cave-like feel, while throwing back reflections of the beech forest when the cedar door is rolled back. Erco lights, Boffi fittings and a suspended black fireplace add touches of luxury to the almost monastic space. “It’s got a little bit more comfort than a monastery,” Fearon admits. “But it definitely references that kind of asceticism. It’s deliberately been left as a fairly raw construction finish.” \r\nThe exterior, likewise, is almost rustic, but has been sharpened through the use of raw steel and floor-to-ceiling windows. “It’s all pretty traditional material used to reference the region, but it’s been crisped up a bit,” says Fearon. “The concrete and steel together with the heavily plastered schist and the fine steel window sections give it some refinement. The cantilevered corner helps too, in enhancing the sense of the house being carved out of a block.”\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"498\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nAt just 100 square metres, this is one of the more compact projects Fearon Hay has taken on, but the structure of the building is no lightweight matter. “It’s quite intense construction for a small building, but that gave the durability and toughness that the client was after,” says Fearon. The cantilevered roof has the solidity to withstand the weight of snow mass. “You could drive a car down and park it on the roof,” says Hay. “It ain’t going nowhere.” That small scale was something the pair really enjoyed, he continues. “The programme is simple, so we really worked on the detail.” Fearon adds: “The client asked for something that was like a jewel-box, so it was great to work on something on that small scale but with the attention to detail.” u\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\n_Words Melinda Williams<br />\nPhotography Patrick Reynolds_<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>A cave-like cabin near queenstown is the ultimate mountain retreat.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>When it comes to escaping – really escaping – the mountain cabin is a potent architectural symbol of retreat and solitude.

Designed for film producer Owen Hughes and actress Yuri Kinugawa, the house is delightfully simple, as architect Andrew Lister explains. “I love boxes with a passion. But I wouldn’t describe it as just a box – it’s more of a container for living in. I like making houses that don’t look like houses, something that’s a little more abstract.

The client walked into my office on my first day in my own practice.  It was the dream first day.” \r\nBeing long-time friends worked in Hughes’ and Lister’s favour in the project, with an obvious alignment in their creative vision. Among other things, the two shared a love of modern architecture. “We always had the same books,” Lister says. “West Coast American and European Modernism and then Japanese architecture.” Both men had also recently spent time in Japan prior to designing the house, working on the film Memory and Desire, which was directed by Lister’s partner, Niki Caro and starred Yuri Kinugawa. “Designing the house was a matter of combining the kinds of architecture we liked with Japanese style and the New Zealand lifestyle.

Graduating from New Zealand’s only glass-blowing school in Wanganui in 1999, Brown set off for the United States, where she worked for three years with renowned glass artist Josh Simpson. Next stop was England, where she worked with environmental glass artist Neil Wilkin. And just four years ago she returned to New Zealand to set up her studio with Lyndsey Patterson. Diversifying from classical glass forms, Brown creates shell-like glass lights and chandeliers, and works on one-off lighting commissions for clients here and overseas, including one 72-piece installation for a Manhattan apartment.

Graduating from New Zealand’s only glass-blowing school in Wanganui in 1999, Brown set off for the United States, where she worked for three years with renowned glass artist Josh Simpson. Next stop was England, where she worked with environmental glass artist Neil Wilkin. And just four years ago she returned to New Zealand to set up her studio with Lyndsey Patterson. Diversifying from classical glass forms, Brown creates shell-like glass lights and chandeliers, and works on one-off lighting commissions for clients here and overseas, including one 72-piece installation for a Manhattan apartment.

Tracey Collins Interview - Whero\'s New Net giveaway\r\n\r\n!(imgleft)/images/513.jpg! <b>What do you do?</b>\r\nI’m a production and costume designer for live performance, events and the screen. Theatre, film, TV, outdoor spectacles. Sometimes set, sometimes costumes, sometimes the whole lot. I’ve specialised over the years in fantasy based and alternative reality based work.\r\n<b>Who inspires you in your work?</b>\r\nI’m inspired by the art world, all visual artists and film. I particularly find the collaboration process inspiring, I like to work intuitively and organically. People trigger me to look at certain things differently.\r\n<b>What was it like working on <i>Prince Caspian</i>?</b>\r\nIt was amazing on lots of levels – the scale of the production, we had 1,000 people on location in Slovenia. It was a real experience working and collaborating with another culture trying to figure out how to explain technical ideas and concepts when none of us spoke the same language. It was a truly unique globalised project.\r\n<b>What can we expect to see in <i>Whero’s New Net</i>?</b>\r\nA tactile and sculptural set that embraces the many worlds of the play – a London pub, Tolaga Bay, Gisborne, a 1970s Ponsonby flat. It’s an all-encompassing universal set. The way it’s lit and the way the actors perform changes the way you view the world of the set.\r\n<b>What’s the difference between designing for film and stage?</b>\r\nThe process of designing is the same, but film is far more detailed. The camera picks up stitching on a coat, a button-hole, because it’s constantly zooming in on things. Film is very much about the moving photograph – everything has to be perfect. Whereas you’re painting in broad strokes on stage, everything has to be exact on film. <i>Whero’s New Net</i> features a raised stage which creates a more intimate performance; the audience is only five metres from the actors.\r\n>>Visit \"www.the-edge.co.nz\":http://www.the-edge.co.nz\r\n\r\n<br />','	<h4>Lonely Miaow</h4>\n\n	<p><img src=\"/images/517.jpg\" class=\"imgleft\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /> We love a bit of chaaarity, especially when the creative industries take it upon themselves to rally around a particularly sad case.

Sunlight is not important. What counts is the façade a house presents to the public. Who’d hold to these nostrums today? But they do seem to be implicit in Auckland’s heritage controls, which are aimed at preserving rows of villas in the inner suburbs. Because you can’t preserve the architecture without endorsing the values behind it, can you? Council expectations are that even a new house in the Residential 1 area will mimic the forms and features of the existing housing stock, even if that mode of living is way out of date. And they even offer some very nice guidelines and a few helpful committees, too.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"529\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nFranklin Road is one of the most interesting streets in Auckland, a cross section through the city’s architectural and social history. Houses range from little workmen’s cottages at the foggy bottom through boarding houses and respectable villas half way up, then a couple of turreted mansions on top of the sunny ridge. To this ensemble architect Marshall Cook of Cook Sargisson Tarrant and Pirie has added an exemplar of how Aucklanders might live in the inner city. His house respects the scale and texture of its neighbours but is unabashedly new – not for the sake of looking new but because the architect has asked – and answered – the question, ‘What is a house for a twenty-first century family like?’ \r\nWell, it doesn’t look like a villa, for a start. Marshall Cook’s architecture at first glance can seem fairly well mannered compared to the architectural gymnastics of others, but this appearance masks deep attention to one of the fundamental questions addressed by good domestic architecture: how can the design of a family house contribute to sustaining and enriching social relationships? As Marshall and his wife Prue talk about this place they come back again and again to the central issue of how the house \r\nfits family life.\r\nThe bravest thing about this house is the way it resists the real estate agents’ lowest common denominator of maximum bathrooms, maximum bedrooms and maximum resale value to come up with a much more flexible plan and far more possibilities for living. (Ironically, this very flexibility may well render the house more saleable, if the time comes.) The heart of the place is a large sunny room with kitchen and table, which opens up on one side to a big courtyard that expands the space of the house in good Auckland fashion. This pavilion is bracketed by a two-storey tower at each end. It’s not unlike a little village, with the towers as winding retreats forming private spaces that overlook a living area akin to a public square. The Cooks are great entertainers – Marshall’s hospitality is rivalled only by his desire for a good old debate around the dinner table.\r\nThrough doors at the far end of the convivial central space, at the quiet end away from the street, is a snug little book-lined space and stairs to the main bedroom above. Above the garage at the opposite end – the street end – is a little enclave of spaces that can be opened up or closed off in various permutations to house combinations of visitors such as grandkids and guests. This space isn’t the usual musty little guest room at the sunless end of the house; on the contrary, it is one of the sunniest spots in the house and, with its combination of bed and living spaces, could be kids’ wing, elderly parents’ quarters or office and guest room. (These days kids don’t leave home until they’re 30 and when they do one of your debilitated parents moves in.)\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"527\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nArchitects are fond of coming up with concrete solutions to their clients’ briefs, but few house plans accept change is constant, or that families might have a need for flexibility over several decades. What makes the plan of this house work so well is the layering of privacy, through sliding doors and internal windows, that allows the place to be set up for any combination of visitors without everyone feeling as though they’re camped on top of each other. The central living space and kitchen, however, acts as a gathering spot that, for example, draws teens from their introspective lairs into family life. Marshall Cook describes both this house and his former family home (see page 116) as explorations into the spatial arrangement of the life of the contemporary family, rather than designs for the historical or ideal one. \r\nIronically, though, the Cook House has a couple of things in common with the old-fashioned villas it rejects.

Sunlight is not important. What counts is the façade a house presents to the public. Who’d hold to these nostrums today? But they do seem to be implicit in Auckland’s heritage controls, which are aimed at preserving rows of villas in the inner suburbs. Because you can’t preserve the architecture without endorsing the values behind it, can you? Council expectations are that even a new house in the Residential 1 area will mimic the forms and features of the existing housing stock, even if that mode of living is way out of date. And they even offer some very nice guidelines and a few helpful committees, too.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"529\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>Franklin Road is one of the most interesting streets in Auckland, a cross section through the city’s architectural and social history. Houses range from little workmen’s cottages at the foggy bottom through boarding houses and respectable villas half way up, then a couple of turreted mansions on top of the sunny ridge. To this ensemble architect Marshall Cook of Cook Sargisson Tarrant and Pirie has added an exemplar of how Aucklanders might live in the inner city. His house respects the scale and texture of its neighbours but is unabashedly new – not for the sake of looking new but because the architect has asked – and answered – the question, ‘What is a house for a twenty-first century family like?’ <br />\nWell, it doesn’t look like a villa, for a start. Marshall Cook’s architecture at first glance can seem fairly well mannered compared to the architectural gymnastics of others, but this appearance masks deep attention to one of the fundamental questions addressed by good domestic architecture: how can the design of a family house contribute to sustaining and enriching social relationships? As Marshall and his wife Prue talk about this place they come back again and again to the central issue of how the house <br />\nfits family life.<br />\nThe bravest thing about this house is the way it resists the real estate agents’ lowest common denominator of maximum bathrooms, maximum bedrooms and maximum resale value to come up with a much more flexible plan and far more possibilities for living. (Ironically, this very flexibility may well render the house more saleable, if the time comes.) The heart of the place is a large sunny room with kitchen and table, which opens up on one side to a big courtyard that expands the space of the house in good Auckland fashion. This pavilion is bracketed by a two-storey tower at each end. It’s not unlike a little village, with the towers as winding retreats forming private spaces that overlook a living area akin to a public square. The Cooks are great entertainers – Marshall’s hospitality is rivalled only by his desire for a good old debate around the dinner table.<br />\nThrough doors at the far end of the convivial central space, at the quiet end away from the street, is a snug little book-lined space and stairs to the main bedroom above. Above the garage at the opposite end – the street end – is a little enclave of spaces that can be opened up or closed off in various permutations to house combinations of visitors such as grandkids and guests. This space isn’t the usual musty little guest room at the sunless end of the house; on the contrary, it is one of the sunniest spots in the house and, with its combination of bed and living spaces, could be kids’ wing, elderly parents’ quarters or office and guest room. (These days kids don’t leave home until they’re 30 and when they do one of your debilitated parents moves in.)</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"527\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>Architects are fond of coming up with concrete solutions to their clients’ briefs, but few house plans accept change is constant, or that families might have a need for flexibility over several decades. What makes the plan of this house work so well is the layering of privacy, through sliding doors and internal windows, that allows the place to be set up for any combination of visitors without everyone feeling as though they’re camped on top of each other. The central living space and kitchen, however, acts as a gathering spot that, for example, draws teens from their introspective lairs into family life. Marshall Cook describes both this house and his former family home (see page 116) as explorations into the spatial arrangement of the life of the contemporary family, rather than designs for the historical or ideal one. <br />\nIronically, though, the Cook House has a couple of things in common with the old-fashioned villas it rejects. What makes the villa so good, and what has ensured its survival, isn’t the pretty, frilly façade that Council is intent on protecting, but the plan that allows us to use various rooms in different ways – you can swap around living room, bedroom, study and so on. We might use certain rooms in summer because they are shady and others in winter because they get the sun.

I felt a tad sorry for the 80+ year-old man sitting stage left, mere metres away from the two naked men going at it like a couple of teenagers. While this caused a communal cheer from (most of) the audience, he watched on stony-faced. This is not a play for the fainthearted. Centred on four characters – the actor, the agent, the rent boy and the girlfriend – <i>The Little Dog Laughed</i>’s writer obviously wasn’t listening when someone declared ‘less is more’. The play’s a fabulous slice of the Hollywood scene, big personalities, big hair and big...egos.

Both sketcher and subject, artist and athlete, John Pusateri, in his new exhibition <i>Wrest</i>, draws movement and musculature with near photographic accuracy. In a series of works depicting a sinewed and muscular young man and woman in explosive yet graceful combat, Pusateri’s forms come alive within the frame. Wrestling is historically symbolic of masculine power, but in each of these scenarios, the female opponent looks to have overwhelmed her male counterpart. Not unlike a Clark/Brash battle of three years ago, though this weekend’s bout might not be so clear-cut.

This play should’ve been emblazoned <span class=\"caps\">NSFGP</span>. I had the happy opportunity to go to <i>The Little Dog Laughed</i> last week, and no play has ever made me laugh so hard. The grandparents sitting in the front row, though? Another story entirely. I felt a tad sorry for the 80+ year-old man sitting stage left, mere metres away from the two naked men going at it like a couple of teenagers. While this caused a communal cheer from (most of) the audience, he watched on stony-faced. This is not a play for the fainthearted. Centred on four characters – the actor, the agent, the rent boy and the girlfriend – <i>The Little Dog Laughed</i>’s writer obviously wasn’t listening when someone declared ‘less is more’. The play’s a fabulous slice of the Hollywood scene, big personalities, big hair and big&#8230;egos.

The announcement of this year’s winner, Peter Robinson, on 31 October at the Auckland Maritime Museum was no different. While the well-dressed crowd of art patrons, gallery owners, and artists clapped when the second-time nominee&#8217;s name was read out, many murmuring, &#8216;yes, he deserved it…&#8217; there was one guest who stormed off to the toilets to splash water on his face, such was his disappointment and amazement in the choice. Robinson&#8217;s project, <i><span class=\"caps\">ACK</span></i>, is an overgrown garden of slithering white forms carved from Styrofoam.

They got as far as ‘B’ and thought Brogan was aptly odd enough then decided that in order to add further difficulty to my life they’d change the spelling. So for the last 35 years nobody’s been able to spell it correctly. The real challenge though came when I was about 18, when dropping the ‘r’ meant I was suddenly associated with a group of people I had nothing in common with. Hilarious for people around me.\r\n\r\n*What attracted you to design?* \r\nI started designing about 20 years ago when I was back in school. All of a sudden I’d found something I loved doing and it didn’t involve exams.\r\n\r\n*You moved to France a few years ago. Tell us about that and why you went.*\r\nI moved to France because I met a French woman when I was living in London, who’s now my wife. We did some travelling and then decided we’d live together in the place she grew up, that happened to be Paris. At the beginning I had a love/hate relationship with Paris but with time I came to really love the place. On the one hand it’s a beautiful city filled with an eccentric array of cultures that’s always alive and buzzing with a plethora of things to do.  On the other hand it’s steeped in bureaucracy, can be narrow minded, suffocatingly traditional and leave you feeling emotionally worn out. After a few years of integrating myself into French culture I began to understand the French for who they were outside the clichés. And with that insight the culture came to life and France became a great place to live. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"685\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Could you speak French when you went?* \r\nI studied French at school in 4th form which was a great advantage. That meant that upon my arrival I could count to ten, and say hello and goodbye. Obviously I wasn’t going anywhere in a hurry, so I thought I could rely on my English. The French do learn English at school for eight years so they can all speak it, but they won’t.  To the French being French meant they weren’t about to make my life easy. It was apparent that I had no choice but to learn the language, if I was to stay there. So I enrolled in some lessons. After a couple of months I felt confident enough to take my first brief for a design job. It was a total disaster, I only understood about one word in 50. Fortunately I was working with companies in England and Holland where people spoke English and where there was a great graphic design culture. Then I started working with French designers and my French quickly progressed.\r\n\r\n*As a designer, what were the advantages of working in Europe?*\r\nEurope is the home of graphic design and continues to produce compelling work. It was great being surrounded by interesting people working on interesting projects. Budgets for client-related work are much higher than what we have in New Zealand, which means there’s more money to generate high-end design work and employ specialised talent. In my case this gave me more spare time to work on personal design projects where the emphasis was on creativity. Being in a city like Paris was also beneficial in that it was easy to work with surrounding European countries.  I could work via the internet with a company in Holland for example from my studio in Paris and, if needed, travel to Amsterdam and be there in four hours. It gave a feeling of being connected on a larger scale with my work.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"688\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*You were involved with the design of the very popular and well-known publicity campaign for the 2002 European Football Cup. How did you get involved with this?*\r\nThe advertising agency Publicis in Paris wanted to generate a series of graphics to create hype for the 2002 European Football Cup. They had seen my work and wanted to commission me to create the graphics. These were put up on billboards and bus shelters around Paris. They also installed a massive screen surrounded by the graphics at Hotel de Ville in the centre of Paris, where people collected to watch the matches.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"687\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*You have recently moved back to  New Zealand. What are the advantages  and disadvantages of working as a designer here?*\r\nI moved to New Zealand because I wanted to start my own design company, which is more complicated in France. Upon my return I found it more difficult to find work than I’d expected. My work for the last 10 years was European based and I don’t think people on the local market could relate to it. After a few jobs, though, that changed. My biggest frustration was the smaller budgets. This would normally mean spending less time on the work, but it just isn’t possible. The work takes the same amount of time regardless of how much it pays. It’s meant I work more on a larger number of projects. The good side is that I get greater creative freedom because fewer people are involved and because I’m now reputed for doing creative work. The culture here is such that people listen to my expertise as a designer, especially within the corporate design sector. In France you get asked to design logos for companies who have little understanding of what you do and the benefit you can add to their company. Whereas in New Zealand you are able to help transform the vision of a business through the interpretation of their identity. It’s been interesting for me to approach design at a level where an understanding of business is paramount, where you can really help people’s businesses. As New Zealand’s not a country steeped in tradition it invents and reinvents itself as it moves towards the future. With this comes fresh perspectives and the need for innovation. We need to be new and different to succeed. So for me New Zealand’s a great place to be a graphic designer, it’s the feeling of isolation that can make it a difficult place to be.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"683\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*What do you value in good graphic design?* \r\nFor me good graphic design is a combination of an intelligent solution combined with high-quality crafting, ideally from a unique perspective. I don’t have much time for design that’s just about following a trend or design that’s buried deep in unnecessary graphic gimmickry. Ultimately graphic design has a job to do in providing better communication and increasing revenue for a product or service. For me it’s about finding an original way  of doing this.\r\n\r\n*Much of your design work seems to  be for other creatives, musicians’ album covers or Karen Walker’s Resene paint range. What is it like working with creatives from various fields?*\r\nCreatives can be an odd breed. They can have a very clear vision for their own creativity which can be impossible to work with. I think I’ve been lucky to have worked with creatives who are truly creative in the sense that they’re open minded and able to either appreciate the expertise of other people or be flexible in creating a graphic interpretation of their own creative outlet.  If you’re able to work with an open-minded creative then you may have difficulty paying your bills but you’ll be able to produce interesting work.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"686\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Some critics are derisive of designers moving between mediums. You have recently started designing lamps although your background is in graphic design. Are the techniques in product or graphic design different? Do you think that designers can or should move freely between design mediums?*\r\nWhen my work is on a personal level I design whatever I feel inclined to design whether that be a piece of furniture, a graphic or other. I don’t feel the need to suppress my creativity to one particular bent. The creative people I admire from today and the past all tried their hands at a diverse range of mediums and I think that diversity is important. Though there are practicalities that need to be considered in the process. Designing a lamp for example is quite different to designing a poster and therefore demands different considerations. Either way it’s a piece of design and if it’s design related and I’ll feel the inkling then I’ll design it. Damn the critics.\r\n\r\n*What are you working on at the moment?*\r\nI’m working on a series of photos with a photographer for an exhibition, a TV ad, another lamp, a packaging project and renovating my house.\r\n\r\n*www.thingwebsite.com*\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"684\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>  <strong>After a stint in Paris, graphic designer Brogen Averill has returned to New Zealand to set up shop.</strong></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Brogen is an interesting name.  Is it traditional, or do you have fantastically eccentric parents?</strong> <br />\nI have eccentric parents who decided the best place to look for an original name for their son was in the White Pages.

Nature in all its raw glory finds its way into pieces by four innovative jewellery designers.*\r\n\r\nThe voice of Edina Monsoon from Absolutley Fabulous is ringing in my ear: “I’m also getting some of those lip plates from dead Amazonian Indians. I thought we could sell them as ashtrays. Don’t look at me like that, darling. We do take the lip off, you know!” Edina would have loved what these jewellers do: taxidermied birds; gilded claws and talons; and fish scales strung as beads. Yet, these materials aren’t actually so far removed from traditional gems. Rather than pull stones and metals out from under the earth, these jewellers scour the ground, transforming the (very) unexpected into something quite asounding. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"612\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Julia de Ville*\r\nA choker featuring a dead bird, a bracelet of bird bones, brooches of mice with emerald or ruby eyes and silver tails, or of small bats with bared teeth… Julia de Ville’s jewellery may appear grotesque and confrontational but it is, in fact, a celebration of the wonders of nature. \r\nFor the New Zealand-born, Melbourne-based jeweller and artist, using whole or parts of animals that have died through natural causes and decorating them with precious stones and metals is, she says, “about a love of animals”. \r\n“Taxidermy is a very powerful medium and I have a message I am trying to get out. I am very vocal in my beliefs and morals and hope I can start making changes to the way people think about animals and death, to make them more accepting of their own mortality.”  \r\nFor someone who turned vegetarian at nine, then wore her grandmother’s fox fur stole because “it was as good as having the animal near me” and by 15 knew she wanted to learn the art of taxidermy, Julia’s future path was cast at a young age. At 26 she exhibited at New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology alongside fashion luminaries such as Jean-Paul Gaultier and John Galliano, at last September’s Gothic Glamour exhibition.\r\nBeing an animal rights activist, de Ville bases her art on “only materials that have been found or donated” to her. It is an organic process, with the resulting creations evolving naturally from what she has to work with. Mostly this is birds and mice but recently she has come across cats, and has been given two puppies and some sea horses. She has even started a fly and bee collection. What they will turn into she is yet to reveal. _Jane Riley_\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"613\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Deadly Ponies Precious*\r\nFor almost four years, designers Liam Bowden and Katie Smith have been turning out covetable leather bags and quirky animal-motif jewellery pieces under their label Deadly Ponies. This season, however, they’ve taken their jewellery collection to the next level, stepping up from the metallic bows and miniature animals they’d previously produced to cast-bronze bird claws and delicate bone flower buds and rosary beads. “We started out by playing around each season and then throwing it all out and starting fresh for the next collection,” explains Bowden. “We didn’t want these pieces to be so disposable. We wanted them to have more of an heirloom quality and nature has that. Also, we just liked [bones and animal skeletons] and found them interesting.”\r\nBowden and Smith met while both studying for their Bachelor of Design at Unitec, and while both majored in graphic design, they spent their weekends together working on projects of a more three-dimensional nature. Their bags were picked up by Auckland store Superette, and their first jewellery collection, Lion in My Pocket, followed soon after.\r\nFor this collection, they trawled beaches, back gardens, and the farms and forests near Smith’s home for bird skeletons, turning up delicate sparrow legs and pukeko skulls. “It was a little bit macabre,” Bowden admits. “I guess because we’re not actually killing the animals it doesn’t seem so bad. We just find skeletons. Nature’s already done its work.” They commissioned a local carver to create the bone pieces, and took casts of the skeletons, then reproduced the claws and skulls in bronze, which was oxidised and polished back to give it a more realistic feel. Some of the pieces have been ‘capped’ in silver, to “hide a bit of the naturalism”, says Bowden. “We have to be conscious of the level to which people like natural things. They don’t want something that’s too raw or too macabre. We’re just waiting for someone to ask us to do an exhibition piece so we can try out some of our more crazy ideas.” _Melinda Williams_\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"614\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Pauline Bern*\r\nSince the late 1970s Pauline Bern has been honing her jewellery-making craft in New Zealand. What started out as an experiment after dropping out of university, travelling and “doing the whole soul-searching thing” has become a career that has spanned three decades. But the roots of her interest in jewellery go back all the way to her youth, she says. “My childhood was spent with my nose pointing at my feet, always picking stuff up. I’m a magpie… a lot of jewellers are.” In the 1980s she began using shells in her work, but it wasn’t until she designed a lei in the 1990s using Sunlight soap and clean nappy fabric that she became seriously engaged with the idea of repurposing found materials in her jewellery.\r\n“Found materials bring a prior reading,” she explains. “People can recognise them as coming from somewhere else. I like the other life of a found material, and I like to try to trigger other memories through my pieces. Jewellery is a mnemonic.” Many of her works feature pieces of pohutukawa driftwood, scoria and water-worn flotsam and jetsam discovered on her walks along Narrow Neck Beach on Auckland’s North Shore. In Bern’s hands, tiny jewels are inserted into the small pieces of wood or rock, which are then strung onto fine pieces of wire or plastic, sometimes wrapped in strips of gold or silver. Bern says she enjoys the contradictions in the materials – things with no practical value paired with precious metals and gems. “Gold is such a permanent material. It doesn’t alter with time, which is why it has been the material of choice for jewellers. But by using materials that are fragile, I make things that people have to look after. They’re things that we just tromp all over, the everyday, the banal. By turning them into jewellery, I can make people notice that they have important or beautiful qualities.” _Melinda Williams_\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"615\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Catarina Hällzon Momentary*\r\nScaled a fish before? Or at least stood aside and watched as the fishmonger takes to one, silvery scales pinging from the skin and lightly ricocheting off the white plastic apron? The scales are then scrubbed down, washed away, tossed into a bin. But not if Catarina Hällzon is around. Hällzon, a jewellery designer from Stockholm, makes jewellery from animal parts that are usually considered waste: elk teeth, pig intestines and fish skin and scales. \r\nIn her recent collection, Momentary, it is in the manipulation of these delicate parts that her jewellery transforms from smelly compost filling to something precious. She variously tans, sews, and dries the skin or innards, and often gilds the pieces or adds miniscule gems which highlight the inherent imperfections of nature while connecting her work to traditional jewellery-making.\r\nAlthough the materials Hällzon uses make the range sound gory or barbaric, her ideas often spring from a way to use the waste left over from a fishing trip or elk hunt. Her work may sound macabre but she prefers to think of her work as lending new life. _Nicole Stock_','	<p></txp:if_individual_article> <strong>Would you pin fish skin to your chest, tether a piece of driftwood to your finger with wire, or hang a bird skull around your neck?

I’m a magpie… a lot of jewellers are.” In the 1980s she began using shells in her work, but it wasn’t until she designed a lei in the 1990s using Sunlight soap and clean nappy fabric that she became seriously engaged with the idea of repurposing found materials in her jewellery.<br />\n“Found materials bring a prior reading,” she explains. “People can recognise them as coming from somewhere else. I like the other life of a found material, and I like to try to trigger other memories through my pieces. Jewellery is a mnemonic.” Many of her works feature pieces of pohutukawa driftwood, scoria and water-worn flotsam and jetsam discovered on her walks along Narrow Neck Beach on Auckland’s North Shore. In Bern’s hands, tiny jewels are inserted into the small pieces of wood or rock, which are then strung onto fine pieces of wire or plastic, sometimes wrapped in strips of gold or silver. Bern says she enjoys the contradictions in the materials – things with no practical value paired with precious metals and gems. “Gold is such a permanent material. It doesn’t alter with time, which is why it has been the material of choice for jewellers. But by using materials that are fragile, I make things that people have to look after. They’re things that we just tromp all over, the everyday, the banal. By turning them into jewellery, I can make people notice that they have important or beautiful qualities.” <em>Melinda Williams</em></p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"615\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Catarina Hällzon Momentary</strong><br />\nScaled a fish before? Or at least stood aside and watched as the fishmonger takes to one, silvery scales pinging from the skin and lightly ricocheting off the white plastic apron? The scales are then scrubbed down, washed away, tossed into a bin. But not if Catarina Hällzon is around. Hällzon, a jewellery designer from Stockholm, makes jewellery from animal parts that are usually considered waste: elk teeth, pig intestines and fish skin and scales. <br />\nIn her recent collection, Momentary, it is in the manipulation of these delicate parts that her jewellery transforms from smelly compost filling to something precious. She variously tans, sews, and dries the skin or innards, and often gilds the pieces or adds miniscule gems which highlight the inherent imperfections of nature while connecting her work to traditional jewellery-making.<br />\nAlthough the materials Hällzon uses make the range sound gory or barbaric, her ideas often spring from a way to use the waste left over from a fishing trip or elk hunt. Her work may sound macabre but she prefers to think of her work as lending new life. <em>Nicole Stock</em></p>','','','/images/612.jpg','mag-article','Issue-49',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','Dead-Modern','','','','','','','','','','','df6d0fdf3eca2474cf4fdf3d150a422b','2008-11-28'),(300,'2008-11-28 07:41:11','isaac.hindinmiller','2008-11-28 07:48:24','','City Lights','','<txp:if_individual_article>\r\n_Words Nicole Stock\r\nPhotography Trevor Mein_\r\n</txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\n*Perched on a tight urban site in central Melbourne, this stone-clad house by BE ARCHITECTURE has flipped expectations in the creation of a light-filled retreat.*\r\n\r\nThe benefit of city living is that you are in the middle of everything. The disadvantage of city living is that you are in the middle of everything. It’s great when you want the vibrancy and the energy of bars and shops and people right outside. But those same things, the noise, the hordes, the traffic, can also be the things you want to shelter from. This is the conundrum faced by the city house: how to design a building to let the city in but simultaneously shut it out. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article>\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"556\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n</txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nThis house, designed by BE Architecture in Melbourne, elegantly resolves this inherent contradiction. Abutted by a traditional terraced house on one shoulder, the house sits on the corner of a busy intersection. It acts as a bookend, its blank and geometric form solidly finishing the street and containing the eclectic mix of styles within the street into its parenthetic hold.\r\nThe clients came to the architects before they bought the site asking at this early stage what the architects could do with the piece of land. As is often the case, the most interesting sites are those that have some difficulties. The tight urban plot was rich in potential being a corner site with a strong visual presence on the street and positioned to enjoy the animated environment bustling around it. It was also, however, a tight and narrow site and those issues of noise and passers-by created some difficulties about how to design for both openness and privacy.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"557\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe solution was to flip the usual planning arrangement of the traditional terraced house. Instead of arranging the living areas on the ground floor with the bedrooms above, the ground floor was reserved for guest rooms and service rooms such as the laundry while the living area and master bedroom were elevated above the street for acoustic and visual privacy. \r\nThe entry also shifted on the plan. Rather than traditionally entering into the middle of the house and arriving at a central corridor, which would have the effect of splitting the house into two, here the entry corridor was reallocated to the side where it becomes an intermediate space. This corridor leads to a double-height foyer that is filled with a large, geometric stair, a modern interpretation of the grand curving staircase.\r\nAny loss of majesty from cordoning the entry hall to the side is more than made up for with the sense of occasion and arrival when you get to the stair. The entry thoroughfare, this link of front door, side corridor, then foyer and stair, all succeed in flowing seamlessly from one element to the next. There is an organic sense of movement in this path which the crank in the stair helps accentuate, contrasting with the rigid architecture of the rest of the house. The rich, waxed blackwood timber, used freely on the risers, the stair walls, and its underside, also provides pleasant contrast to the stone used on the exterior and highlights the stair as a feature. \r\nOnce upstairs, the entire living area opens up, making the most of the full floor plan not divided by any hall or stairs. Here, however, there is a distinct separation of spaces, the living areas don’t mingle with the master bedroom, and this whole floor now perches quite separately from the downstairs areas underscoring the way the architects have designed each space to be used for a single purpose. Hints of tradition lie in this arrangement, a Victorian ideal of individual, autonomous rooms.\r\nThe elevated position of the main bedroom and living spaces not only helps to create a sense of separation from the road below, but it also maximises north light to these spaces and allows for views over the city. The clients wanted this house to suit how they live now. Their children had left home and they had grandchildren. They wanted to accommodate their family for short stays, but for the rest of the time they didn’t want the house to feel too large.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"555\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe planning reflects this. The major spaces of the house, those that will be used often, are all located on the first floor. The other spaces, tucked underneath, can be closed off and generally ignored in the owners’ day-to-day living. This separation also allows for privacy and space for family and grandchildren when they stay, allowing them to come and go freely.\r\nThe living area is quite contained; it doesn’t need to spread out gluttonously to accommodate two people, but the open planning between kitchen, dining and living still lets this room be filled for entertaining. Elements of tradition have again been folded into the modern arrangement. Since the living area is contained, the kitchen island was stepped down from the functional bench height on the kitchen side to a lower height on the living side. The architects detailed this as a piece of furniture, with subtle routed-out door handles. This ‘sideboard’ is also fashioned from the rich Australian blackwood that was seen in the sculptural stair, creating a continuity of materials throughout the house. This use of timber is again taken through to the bunkrooms and downstairs hallway. \r\nThis focus on detailing is also seen in the large, six-metre-long window in the north-western corner of the living room. The window’s solid frame has been designed to feel like a balustrade edging a deck which further builds a sense of privacy and maximises the useable space of the room. This large corner slot can be seen from the street, but it is one of the few windows that puncture the austere box. But of course light and fresh air is a necessity in a home. The solution was to create light courts, vertical open air shafts that terminate in a small garden. The master bedroom has large panes of glass that look out into the garden and the room is filled with diffuse light. As much of the light direction wafts in from above, the rooms take on a pleasantly murky, celestial appearance.\r\nThe exterior is more of this earth. Clad in bluestone, a readily available natural material that references urban Melbourne as it is used in the city’s municipal paving, the stone’s muted blue-grey colour helps anchor the building to the site. Neither an ominous dark black, nor a gleaming white, the rugged cladding manages to add strength to the corner site but the soft colour means the house retreats into its environment and doesn’t become an urban eyesore. The way your eye flits over the stone, shifting as you walk past, mimics the movement of traffic and people around the site, further tying the house to its environment.\r\nPerhaps most enticing about the cladding is the tactile texture of the banded strips of stone. Three widths of bands were used and the depth of each piece was adjusted. Not only did this lend a welcome texture and softening of the exterior but the pattern also allowed for an easier application to the building, the randomness hides any slight imperfections in the laying. \r\nThe plays on the conflicting issues of retreat and exhibition are why this house is a success. All those necessary issues of light, noise, privacy, and space have not only been considered but have informed the design. This is a house shaped by light. Its heavy, solid form wouldn’t initially suggest this, but within those exterior walls, light has been used as a material rather than just considered as an environmental occurrence. Here, something commonplace has been shaped into the extraordinary. u ','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\n_Words Nicole Stock<br />\nPhotography Trevor Mein_<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Perched on a tight urban site in central Melbourne, this stone-clad house by BE <span class=\"caps\">ARCHITECTURE</span> has flipped expectations in the creation of a light-filled retreat.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>The benefit of city living is that you are in the middle of everything.

Architecture firm Patterson Associates, headed by Andrew Patterson, is a firm that has become known for its contemporary and bold forms. Clients Annie and Colin Mantell are owners of Mantells, the Mt Eden-based boutique function centre. More recently they have added Wanaka Lodge, located on the edge of Lake Wanaka, to their collection of hospitality venues.\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"742\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\nWanaka Lodge’s building is rectilinear with double height spaces, modern, gleaming kitchens, and oversized, square-edged windows – all sparse, clean and unapologetically modern. Inside, decorated by Annie and Colin, the spaces have been filled with Italianate and French- inspired candelabras, silvered mirrors and extravagant chandeliers. \r\nThis is a battle of styles fought between equals who obviously respect each other. So while there does seem to be a clash of cultures it feels almost like two wild animals parading and braying but never coming to blows. It could be this frisson that’s created a more sincere and distinctive space than if the architecture and interior design echoed each other more closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"740\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe design concept, too, was approached in different ways. “We gave [Andrew Patterson] the idea, a picture of a masseria, a fortified stone building in Southern Italy with an insular courtyard,” says Annie Mantell. The term masseria comes from the Italian word maceria – wall, which more specifically, in Roman times, meant a rough wall having no facing. The schist of the Lodge, then, simultaneously references the surrounding Southern landscape and ties the building to the Italian form the clients suggested. \r\nPatterson conversely talked of the form developing from the brief requiring two residential units and a large garage for a luxury campervan. The massing of these three blocks, along with the functional aspect of a sheltered courtyard, created the form: a solid, geometric, three-sided building that could be shut down into single units or opened up to have all three areas in use at once. \r\nAgain, this may seem like a clash, but it isn’t the case. Rather, here you have two visions, both of which are looking in the same direction, but perhaps focusing on different parts of that view. Though architect and client may describe the process of arriving at the courtyard form differently, the courtyard is the central idea in this project. What is significant is that rather than being an empty void, it has a sense of fullness and energy from the stepped water feature and a large tree that filters light and rustles as the wind changes. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"739\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe three-sided, solid stone building is hemmed in by two electric, oversized doors in corrugated polycarbonate that enclose the courtyard, giving privacy from the main road, and shelter from winds across the lake. The doors lend a note of surprise to the façade and relieve the schist building from being oppressively heavy or old fashioned. Throughout the house, careful details of a tight control over materials have ensured the house is distinctly modern and crisp. Even with the schist, the absolute rigid geometries of the walls make the elevations slick and modern. \r\nThe main kitchen, built specifically for Annie (previously chef and  owner of the French Cafe), is dark and glossy with thick, substantial granite benchtops contrasting with chrome and stainless appliances and tapware. While it has the gloss of a show kitchen, it also has the industrial, functional feel of a restaurant kitchen, and indeed, can be put to use for functions and events. \r\nOff the kitchen, the living room is a huge vault of a space, the proportions have a luxury and generosity to them. Terrazzo floors and walls not painted but left as a raw plaster finish tie the interiors to the European-styled furnishings in a subtle way. The huge windows frame aspects of the view like a gilt mirror in an Italian villa, but the clean aluminium edging stays firmly contemporary, giving postcard-like shots of New Zealand. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"741\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nWanaka Lodge is a successful piece of architecture, a building that operates comfortably as an apartment for two, or as two separate units for rental, or as a large communal house for a big family. There is simultaneously a sense of boldness to the architecture, a strength that comes equally from the masseria concept and contemporary planning, and a cosiness enhanced by the interiors that soften the strict spaces and create a distinct experience for guests and visitors.

Atelier Van Lieshout: Cascade !(imgleft)/images/942.jpg! \r\n\r\nCheery Dutch artist Joep Van Lieshout has already taken the idea of sustainability to sinister extremes with SlaveCity, a profit-focused architectural distopia where humans are recycled at the end of their productive life. His studio, Atelier Van Lieshout, also unveiled a new sculpture in Rotterdam\'s international port earlier this week. Cascade stands at eight metres tall and is made of polyester and 18 stacked oil drums, which appear to descend from above in a monumental column. A syrupy mass dripping from the drums forms human figures. Intentionally referencing the victory columns of previous centuries, Van Lieshout\'s work is in fact an anti-monument, a social statement about the economic crisis and exhaustion of raw materials. So that\'s nice.\r\n\r\n>> Visit \"Atelier Van Lieshout\":http://www.ateliervanlieshout.com\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nh4.

Louis Vuitton Pacific Series\r\n\r\n!(imgleft)/images/571.jpg! Cup fever has hit Auckland with the start of the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series on the weekend. \r\n\r\nYachting is a sport centred around design so it is apt that Louis Vuitton, the sponsor of the Louis Vuitton Cup Series worked with New Zealand design company Coast in the design and furnishing of the VIP hospitality areas at the Pacific Cup base. The company’s design team has utilised many techniques and materials found the yacht-building industry, ensuring that all of its furniture and accessories will withstand New Zealand’s outdoor environment while looking stylish. Coast then also collaborated with design company Essenze to accessorise the VIP lounges with lamps, glassware and pottery from many of New Zealand’s leading artisans. \r\n\r\nFor those of you who wont be able to slip into the VIP area, there are many other art and design nooks open to the public. Head to the Louis Vuitton store to see the exhibition <i>Wind and Sails</i> that chronicles the history of the Louis Vuitton Cup and the America\'s Cup through photography. The exhibition runs from Jan 29 to Feb 15 at Louis Vuitton, 56 Queen Street.

Some people seem to have that golden touch with finding \'vintage\' gems at the Sallies, but I\'ve recently discovered that these style-makers can also lay down a lot of dosh on beautiful pieces, but with the rigorous understanding that less is more, quality rather than quantity, patience is a virtue, what other chestnuts can I come up with…? My most stylish friend wears the same clothes all the time, but they are layered and tailored in infinite combinations that that scrap of Zambesi always looks fresh even though it is five years old. \r\n\r\nAs with Zen and cricket, self control is hugely important is achieving style on a budget.

But it will be that pause between a rush of excitement and the cash register that becomes significant. Why buy three cheap tops that will lose their shape when you could buy one that you love that values design, craftsmanship and longevity? It\'s the same with furniture.

Editor\'s Blog\r\n\r\n!(imgright)/images/575.jpg! People become so much less bothersome once you meet them. When they are just a signature at the tail of an email, or a dismembered voice on the phone, or even worse, someone you have never even spoken to but are still a barricade to something you would like to do, it is easy to disparage this phantom-person.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when you meet them, they often turn out to be alright. Such was the case when I went to a spectacular dinner put on by an American couple who own LIMN, a group of design furniture stores in California. They had recently moved here, setting up Pine Valley Bed and Breakfast in Silverdale. Dinner was inside a glasshouse, each piece shipped from Texas, and Paola Navone, the Italian furniture designer, was cooking dinner for the wonderfully odd collection of people. Inside the glasshouse, over thick slabs of tiramisu, I met the owners of the Mai Mai House. \r\n\r\nNow, the Mai Mai house is a house designed by Auckland architect Andrew Paterson. It was short listed for the residential category at the World Architecture Festival and earlier won a national architecture award. The house is small, but stunning. I have seen photos of it. Hardly anyone else has. You see, the owners won’t publish. A pesky wee thorn in my side. The reason, has always been privacy. This, I grudgingly accede is fair enough. Frustrating, from an editor’s point of view, but an occasional hindrance for architectural houses. \r\n\r\nWhat I wasn’t expecting was that this woman, who had previously been an unseen annoyance, was fascinating. And her reason not to publish, rather than privacy, was to retain the integrity of the design concept. Now how many clients believe in their architects vision so much that they end up seeing it more clearly that their architect? I\'ll tell you: not many. Patterson designed this house, a petite, two-storied perch in Ponsonby, the blank front façade pressed with feathers, and called it Mai Mai House. He shot himself in the foot here. Evocative name. But a name that has inevitably crushed his plans for showing it off.\r\n\r\nA Mai Mai is a hideaway, and this house is designed to be just that: a hideaway for a busy couple. To publish, to rip away the side of the Mai Mai and show it off undoes the entire concept. This may seem like PR spin, but she was neither a shy woman, nor particularly private. Rather, she was fiercely intelligent. This is a woman who enrolled herself in a construction course at the architecture school so she wouldn’t have the wool pulled over her eyes while her house was built. And once all the building dust settled, Patterson\'s concept built, it is she and her husband that have valued the deeper meaning behind a piece of architecture, and reminded me that the importance of architecture is much more than a few pretty pictures.

When they are just a signature at the tail of an email, or a dismembered voice on the phone, or even worse, someone you have never even spoken to but are still a barricade to something you would like to do, it is easy to disparage this phantom-person.</p>\n\n	<p>And yet, when you meet them, they often turn out to be alright. Such was the case when I went to a spectacular dinner put on by an American couple who own <span class=\"caps\">LIMN</span>, a group of design furniture stores in California. They had recently moved here, setting up Pine Valley Bed and Breakfast in Silverdale. Dinner was inside a glasshouse, each piece shipped from Texas, and Paola Navone, the Italian furniture designer, was cooking dinner for the wonderfully odd collection of people. Inside the glasshouse, over thick slabs of tiramisu, I met the owners of the Mai Mai House. </p>\n\n	<p>Now, the Mai Mai house is a house designed by Auckland architect Andrew Paterson. It was short listed for the residential category at the World Architecture Festival and earlier won a national architecture award. The house is small, but stunning. I have seen photos of it. Hardly anyone else has. You see, the owners won’t publish. A pesky wee thorn in my side. The reason, has always been privacy. This, I grudgingly accede is fair enough. Frustrating, from an editor’s point of view, but an occasional hindrance for architectural houses. </p>\n\n	<p>What I wasn’t expecting was that this woman, who had previously been an unseen annoyance, was fascinating. And her reason not to publish, rather than privacy, was to retain the integrity of the design concept. Now how many clients believe in their architects vision so much that they end up seeing it more clearly that their architect? I&#8217;ll tell you: not many. Patterson designed this house, a petite, two-storied perch in Ponsonby, the blank front façade pressed with feathers, and called it Mai Mai House. He shot himself in the foot here. Evocative name. But a name that has inevitably crushed his plans for showing it off.</p>\n\n	<p>A Mai Mai is a hideaway, and this house is designed to be just that: a hideaway for a busy couple. To publish, to rip away the side of the Mai Mai and show it off undoes the entire concept. This may seem like PR spin, but she was neither a shy woman, nor particularly private. Rather, she was fiercely intelligent. This is a woman who enrolled herself in a construction course at the architecture school so she wouldn’t have the wool pulled over her eyes while her house was built. And once all the building dust settled, Patterson&#8217;s concept built, it is she and her husband that have valued the deeper meaning behind a piece of architecture, and reminded me that the importance of architecture is much more than a few pretty pictures.

Letting Dwell, at The New Dowse gallery, Wellington, is an exhibition by furniture designer, Tim Larkin in collaboration with photograher, Peter McColl, and writer, Luke Feast, exploring the concept of the food safe. In his food-safe inspired cabinets, Larkin creates evocative spaces through contrasting layers of organic, hand-crafted and machine-worked materials. Alongside this, McColl uses still and moving cameras to explore duration, inhabitation and desertation, which echoes Larkin’s work, and Feast questions the limits of writing philosophically about ‘making’.

Editor\'s Blog \r\n\r\n!(imgleft)/images/575.jpg! The last faint smudge of eyeliner wasn\'t budging this morning as I raced out of the house and into work so I\'m probably looking a bit weary today. However, despite appearances, I\'m feeling rather bright after last night\'s Urbis Designday after-party.\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I have good reason to feel bright. The 2009 Urbis Designday was a huge success. We had record numbers of attendees and some of the most high profile fashion designer – showroom pairings we\'ve ever had. The mini-vans were running every few minutes taking punters from one stop to the next. The transformed showrooms were filled with happy guests lounging with a cocktail or helping themselves to another nibble, and everywhere groups of yellow Designday tote bags were seen bouncing along Auckland\'s streets.\r\n<br />\r\nThe party last night was to congratulate everyone involved with putting the day together. It is a huge task to create these installations and without that dedication we wouldn\'t have Urbis Designday. All of those who spent days painting wooden spoons (Matisse and Karen Walker), or covering chairs with foil (Cite and World) or shovelling sand to make a beach in the city (Coast and Emma Kate Bamford), all deserve to be congratulated for their hard work as everything came together on the day.\r\n<br />\r\nThe purpose of Designday is to pull design out from the pages of Urbis and get it out into the real world. It was so gratifying to see people getting comfortable on an Apartmento sofa or to see the exquisite fabrics and stitching of garments in Jaeha\'s installation at Inovo. Every stop held something entirely different and surprising. Huffer\'s quirky and playful touch was evident in their Free the Fish installation at Poggenpohl while Design Denmark was overrun with Lonely Hearts\' motocross racers.\r\n<br />\r\nIf you missed anything, we will have full coverage of all the Designday installations in the next issue of Urbis so make sure you check it out.\r\n<br />\r\nNow last night we didn\'t just drink Daniel le Brun and enjoy The Westin\'s stunning nibbles, we did get down to some serious business as well. Two awards were given on the night, the first for Best Installation by a Fashion Designer and the second for Best Ambience, awarded to the venue.\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the winners are…. (on the night, instead of a drum roll, at this exact moment, the huge Designday sign at the back of the stage fell, threatening to squash myself and Sarah Hutchings from Orsini jewellery who was preparing to give the winner their prize.) Such dramatics are thankfully avoided in cyberspace. \r\n<br />\r\nSo again. And the winners are: For Best Installation… Lucie Boshier for her prohibition-themed speakeasy at Natuzzi. And for Best Ambience… The Westin for the serene and elegant atmosphere captured with Zambesi\'s beautiful installation. \r\n<br />\r\nCongratulation to all the winners. And congratulations to all the other pairings involved. This year was truly spectacular. I\'m already thinking about next year. Nicole Stock\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nh4.

Orsini generously provided the prize for the Best Installation by a Fashion Designer for Urbis Designday 2009. \r\n\r\n <br />\r\n\r\nThis Pianegonda bracelet is from the Italian ‘Twisty’ collection. The inspiration comes from the 60’s, with that particular design of soft shapes, with that peculiar glance of those years with miniskirts. It’s a part of the historical lines of Pianegonda. Peculiar marks of these pieces are the sinuous movements of the silver spiral; polished surfaces alternated with the diamond cut laser etching.

The 2009 Urbis Designday was a huge success. We had record numbers of attendees and some of the most high profile fashion designer – showroom pairings we&#8217;ve ever had. The mini-vans were running every few minutes taking punters from one stop to the next. The transformed showrooms were filled with happy guests lounging with a cocktail or helping themselves to another nibble, and everywhere groups of yellow Designday tote bags were seen bouncing along Auckland&#8217;s streets.<br />\n<br />\n\nThe party last night was to congratulate everyone involved with putting the day together. It is a huge task to create these installations and without that dedication we wouldn&#8217;t have Urbis Designday. All of those who spent days painting wooden spoons (Matisse and Karen Walker), or covering chairs with foil (Cite and World) or shovelling sand to make a beach in the city (Coast and Emma Kate Bamford), all deserve to be congratulated for their hard work as everything came together on the day.<br />\n<br />\n\nThe purpose of Designday is to pull design out from the pages of Urbis and get it out into the real world. It was so gratifying to see people getting comfortable on an Apartmento sofa or to see the exquisite fabrics and stitching of garments in Jaeha&#8217;s installation at Inovo. Every stop held something entirely different and surprising. Huffer&#8217;s quirky and playful touch was evident in their Free the Fish installation at Poggenpohl while Design Denmark was overrun with Lonely Hearts&#8217; motocross racers.<br />\n<br />\n\nIf you missed anything, we will have full coverage of all the Designday installations in the next issue of Urbis so make sure you check it out.<br />\n<br />\n\nNow last night we didn&#8217;t just drink Daniel le Brun and enjoy The Westin&#8217;s stunning nibbles, we did get down to some serious business as well. Two awards were given on the night, the first for Best Installation by a Fashion Designer and the second for Best Ambience, awarded to the venue.<br />\n<br />\n\nAnd the winners are…. (on the night, instead of a drum roll, at this exact moment, the huge Designday sign at the back of the stage fell, threatening to squash myself and Sarah Hutchings from Orsini jewellery who was preparing to give the winner their prize.) Such dramatics are thankfully avoided in cyberspace. <br />\n<br />\n\nSo again. And the winners are: For Best Installation… Lucie Boshier for her prohibition-themed speakeasy at Natuzzi. And for Best Ambience… The Westin for the serene and elegant atmosphere captured with Zambesi&#8217;s beautiful installation. <br />\n<br />\n\nCongratulation to all the winners. And congratulations to all the other pairings involved. This year was truly spectacular. I&#8217;m already thinking about next year.

The inspiration comes from the 60’s, with that particular design of soft shapes, with that peculiar glance of those years with miniskirts. It’s a part of the historical lines of Pianegonda. Peculiar marks of these pieces are the sinuous movements of the silver spiral; polished surfaces alternated with the diamond cut laser etching.

A construction surge from the 1950s onwards has resulted in a proliferation of residential housing blocks for a quickly growing population, though the city itself has no single dominant architectural idiom. \r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"737\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n“I’ve been practising here for about 30 years, and over that time there have been improvements,” says Pat Hanson, lead architect for the GH3 architecture practice. Echoing a sentiment expressed by many New Zealand architects and designers, she says that the general population of Canada does not expect enough from the built environment – or invest enough in it. “As a culture, we haven’t evolved enough yet. As a nation, we’re not as aware of our cities and our buildings as we should be.”\r\nThe fact that foreign architects, including Frank Gehry, Will Alsop and Daniel Libeskind, have been called in to work on several civic projects over the last five years has, says Hanson, helped by focusing public attention on architecture. “There’s certainly been local resentment, but it has also raised the level of discourse.”\r\nFor an avowed modernist like Hanson, this residential renovation job, which turned the cramped interior of a 1970s building into an urban loft-style minimalist space, was a gift project. The detached townhouse in a row of ten built to a roughly Brutalist template had undergone a series of renovations over a forty-year period that weren’t sympathetic to the original structure.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"736\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n“They’re actually quite fine buildings underneath,” says Hanson. “But by the time the current owners bought it, it had undergone a sort of colonial makeover on the interior.”\r\nNevertheless, the owners knew true love when they saw it. Located on one of the roads that negotiates a ravine escarpment from one part of the city to a lower part of the city, the three-bedroom property is a narrow, bar-shaped building with a roughly 6 by 21m footprint. The slanting site offered privacy for the back garden and, crucially, also for the front of the building, which sits a storey above the street entrance to the garage. \r\nThe first challenge was the interior of the ground floor, which contains the kitchen-dining area to one side, and the living area that opens on to the garden to the other. During a previous renovation it had been divided into smaller spaces. “The building isn’t configured to make separate rooms and retain a sense of spaciousness. It was built at a time when eight-foot ceilings were considered perfectly comfortable,” laughs Hanson. It seemed logical to strip it back and open the space up to an even greater extent than the original design. “We really wanted to take it back to its bare bones.”\r\nThe idea was met with much approval by the new owners, a couple who were raised in architecturally designed houses themselves and have an appreciation for modernist architecture and a minimalist approach to interiors and lifestyle. They also owned a “pretty sophisticated” collection of modern furniture, says Hanson, including pieces by Eames and Saarinen.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"735\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nA key element in opening up the space and making the building more agreeable during the day is a new two-storey window wall on the garden side which brings natural light in to the core of the house, and gives a sense of expansion from the inside to the outside to the rear lawn. The master bedroom, which is above the living area, also benefits from the glass wall, while the sides of the ravine maintain complete privacy.\r\nInside, the team gave structure to the resulting loft-like space by creating three major architectural elements to create a domestic scale and organise the flow of the ground floor. In the kitchen, they built a large island with statuary marble, with one level for food preparation and second lower level for use as a table for both everyday and formal dining. “That piece grounds and establishes the domestic zone of the kitchen,” says Hanson.\r\nThe second element was the spiral stair. Original to the building, it had what Hanson describes as “the worst kind” of wrought iron railing common to many Toronto homes. However, it did work with the shape of the stairs, so the team simply over-clad it with drywall to create a sculptural, curvilinear focal point to the room. Lastly, they created a six metre white marble bench that runs the length of the living room and also acts as a hearth to the fireplace. The kitchen working area, as well as storage for pots and pans, dishes, books and media, is now positioned along the exterior wall behind built-in, floor-to-ceiling doors.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"738\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThough GH3 specialises in sustainable architecture, at Russell Street they found a lot of standard features, such as good insulation to cope with the city’s cold climate, already in place. Hanson added operable skylights for the owners to vent heat during summer, and used high-performance glazing and low VOC paints throughout the house. \r\nUpstairs, the original room configuration – the master bedroom separated by a bridge from the bathroom and two fairly small, narrow bedrooms (one of which is used as a study) – remained the same. \r\nHanson maintained the aesthetic used downstairs by painting most surfaces white or using fabricated white Corian for areas that would come in for more wear, including the bath, shower and wet room walls. The wooden floors and the stairs were stained a near-black, providing a striking contrast. “I tend to favour a really monochromatic palette unless I’m forced to do otherwise,” says the architect. “In this case, the owner was completely sympathetic to it – they were keen to keep really simple white walls. In one large space it is difficult to add multiple wall colours, and there was enough interest with some of the elements in the space and with her furniture to work with that.” This project may look black and white but that’s only a foil for its intricacy.

Those naysayers obviously haven’t met ambitious young fashion designers Aria Campbell and Ruth Ellison, the names behind new fashion label Hopetown.\r\nThe pair met while working as fashion assistants at High Society, the successful New Zealand-based fashion company that designs, manufactures and distributes four fashion labels: Catalyst; Obi; Chocolat and Mosaic. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"745\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nWhen the company wanted to test off-shore production they asked their design teams to come up with a concept for a new brand. Underwear, sleepwear, and sportswear were all proposed, but Campbell and Ellison were interested in keeping to the ready-to-wear aesthetic that High Society was already successful with, but as each of the current brands target niches of the plus 35 age group, they saw opportunity to focus a new label at a much younger bracket.\r\nWhile the management team seemed excited about the idea, in the midst of designing, cutting and marketing the new collections for the current labels, the idea slipped aside.

Those naysayers obviously haven’t met ambitious young fashion designers Aria Campbell and Ruth Ellison, the names behind new fashion label Hopetown.<br />\nThe pair met while working as fashion assistants at High Society, the successful New Zealand-based fashion company that designs, manufactures and distributes four fashion labels: Catalyst; Obi; Chocolat and Mosaic. </p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"745\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>When the company wanted to test off-shore production they asked their design teams to come up with a concept for a new brand. Underwear, sleepwear, and sportswear were all proposed, but Campbell and Ellison were interested in keeping to the ready-to-wear aesthetic that High Society was already successful with, but as each of the current brands target niches of the plus 35 age group, they saw opportunity to focus a new label at a much younger bracket.<br />\nWhile the management team seemed excited about the idea, in the midst of designing, cutting and marketing the new collections for the current labels, the idea slipped aside. Campbell and Ellison weren’t to be deterred and instead of letting it go, the two spent late nights and weekends designing key looks for a small collection.

Our favourite was by architecture firm FAT.

Fletcher Systems Giveaway !(imgleft)/images/762.jpg!\r\n\r\nNew Zealand 3D design and furniture brand Fletcher Systems has recently taken a new direction. Fletcher Vaughan, founder and creative director of Fletcher Systems, believes that there is a lot of design talent in New Zealand and “we should keep it local”. So, rather than have New Zealand designers pitch their work to off-shore furniture brands, Fletcher Systems is focusing its production experience to support and produce other New Zealand designers work under the Fletcher Systems brand. \r\n\r\nUrbis has one Twig Coat Stand designed by Jamie McLellan for Fletcher Systems to give away. To enter, email peta.nichols@agm.co.nz telling us what materials the Twig Coat Stands are made from (you’ll find the answer on the Fletcher Systems website).

In a design climate where the buildings often just fill the planning guidelines, the more promising the site, the greater the opportunity for disappointment. Ironbank occupies the old Deka site which, on the Karangahape ridge, is the perfect opportunity to screw things up. It is a great site, prominent, and in a special street with particular cultural, historical and architectural baggage. There is plenty here to run foul of or bungle. But this building doesn’t disappoint.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"783\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nIronbank is formed of five- six- and seven- storey towers of commercial tenancies. They are arranged to form an internal courtyard and a thoroughfare from Karangahape Road to its rougher cousin, Cross Street, behind. Not only content with building five towers (when one would have done just fine for most developers), the architects, RTA Studio, have displaced each floor from the one below to give the impression of kindergarten day in a shipping yard. From certain elevations, a stack of Ned Kelly rejects also comes to mind. This shuffling of levels is a neat, if complicated, trick. It is lively and provocative to look at and gives each tenancy an identity. Don’t even think of the structural and weathering problems.\r\n\r\nFrom the courtyard an entertaining central lift, the shaft clad in scales of coloured glass, feeds the towers via external walkways. This is no bland corporate experience. The building matters here. Further, each tenancy has two means of egress and stairs abound, adding complexity and interest to what is, in essence, a simple notion of single stacked spaces. The architects have gone to trouble with these stairs, they are made to be used on a day-to-day basis. Perfect for smokers and athletes alike. The exterior journey, especially from the upper floors, is exhilarating.\r\n\r\nIt is a truism, but often forgotten, that it is what a building does rather than what it looks like that really counts in the long run. A seductive scale model or set of presentation drawings can fudge a flawed design. Indeed it can fool the designers as much as the clients and Ironbank, with its wit and novelty, is a good candidate for such a con job. However, there are deeper issues that have been addressed here and they will endure long after the novelty of the elevations has gone.\r\n Context is particularly important. The street photos show how well this cunning set of buildings sits on the street without aping or challenging its neighbours. The obvious maximising of the site is eschewed and the bulk of the towers is set back from Karangahape Road to let the flow of façades continue through reminding the passer-by this is K Road not Queen Street. There is no such delicacy on the Cross Street side, the towers just land bang on the boundary, as do all the other buildings in the street, and they look just fine.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"784\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nSouth, from across the valley, the chaotic nature of the new buildings sits agreeably among the shambolic backsides of the old K Road buildings. The style is unashamedly contemporary yet the materials, new to the street – GRC concrete and rusted weathering steel – fit well with the brick and plaster of the neighbourhood. The street façade panels also serve to screen the upper balconies behind them and provide loopholes from them for views to the street below. It is interesting and useful from both sides and means this isn’t simply a façade but a working unit of the building.\r\n\r\nAt the Karangahape street level, commerce is maintained with street shops flanking the entrance to the courtyard beyond. This entrance has had criticism for being too narrow (it is a respectable 5 metres or so), however a clear call has been made to maximise the street shopfront presentation in keeping with the manner of the street and then treat the courtyard as an internal space.\r\nWithin, the courtyard is planted and the surrounding shops are able to open completely to it. It is a romantic gesture (no doubt presented with drawings of the usual café tables and umbrellas with louche café denizens sipping from complicated glasses and plenty of nonchalant shoppers sprinkled about) but internal courtyards are tricky spaces, great when they work but often planned with rose-tinted glasses and hope. Here the architects have given it every chance of success. It has been planned carefully, the courtyard is designed to be fed by the lift and the Cross Street traffic and with appropriate tenancies at its perimeter it deserves to be the lively space it promises. There is even a water feature prescribed by Feng Shui. How can you go wrong? \r\n\r\nThere is a strong and direct connection to the wonderfully manky and utilitarian Cross Street behind. (Anyone remember the mad 2am markets there in the carpark of the late ’70s?) The development also provides Cross Street with street level shops. This attention to street activity may seem obvious and it is certainly beneficial to the street and neighbourhood, but it is one often ignored or given over to carparking in many developments. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"785\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nThe carparking in this building is a wonder. Simply swipe your card, abandon  your car, and the rest is over to a large yellow machine that sorts and files it. Don’t worry, it checks the back seat for forgotten Chihuahuas and relatives and it is carefully programmed to give you back the car you parked. (I checked, hoping I might be onto an upgrade.)\r\n\r\nThere are four levels of parking below street level, 95 cars, with the stacker saving about a third of conventional parking space requirements. One of the Cross Street shops has been given a window looking into the stacker. It’s not often architects are that proud of their parking.\r\nThe interesting thing about this development is that here, hard-nosed commercialism comes up against individuality and careful design and construction. The developers, Samson Corp, are also responsible for many other singular and enduring developments such as D72, Axis, Site 3 and Cumulus, all of which are successful and well-liked additions to the city. Ironbank is clearly not a result of experimentation or a fanciful rush of blood to the head. It is the result of experience. \r\nGood clients make good buildings. Samson have sought out architects who are competent and able to achieve projects such as this and RTA Studio have an excellent portfolio, particularly with Samson, of rejuvenating fading commercial buildings. Buildings don’t just arrive through some magical process and it takes clients with the initial vision and understanding to be able to initiate (and fund) them. Richard Naish of RTA says Samson led the project, supporting its unconventionality and, at times, asking them to go further, to try harder. These buildings are not short-term investments. Payback comes from point of difference and quality. Special spaces allow for higher rentals and stable tenancies.\r\n\r\nAlthough each floor of each tenancy is a single lettable space, interesting things happen. The differing elevations and orientations deliver views from the distant Waitakeres to adjacent roofscapes that continually surprise as one moves through the building. Far from being insular as one might expect, each tenancy looks (at a civil distance) into, onto and up to each other creating a feeling of community, far more than would occur on a subdivided floorplate.\r\n\r\nWithin each floor is a service tower, wilfully non perpendicular, serviced with the obligatory solar-heated water and decorated with an unexpected embossed wallpaper of an Edwardian pattern. This pattern is repeated in the perforated ceiling panels and stamped into aluminium sheeting which is used vigorously and in a non-Edwardian way as a soffit lining. A sly nod to Karangahape Road’s heritage. \r\n\r\nAs the mention of solar water heating hinted at, this building is green. The building has a low embodied energy, rusting weathering steel replaces paint, and there are environmental strategies in place that no doubt are a good thing, but what I like is that they are not overt. Too often green equals ugly, but not here. Solar panels roughing up the roof line are the most obvious while natural cross ventilation (very Edwardian) is the nicest. \r\n\r\nIronbank is brave and different but above all it is sound. Stripped of its frills the planning is clear and considered and it is exhilarating to be in. We cannot expect all new commercial buildings to be as daring or as extravagant as this but if they get even half the care and design attention that Ironbank has been given, Auckland will be a better place. Supercity take note.

This attention to street activity may seem obvious and it is certainly beneficial to the street and neighbourhood, but it is one often ignored or given over to carparking in many developments. </p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"785\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p>The carparking in this building is a wonder. Simply swipe your card, abandon  your car, and the rest is over to a large yellow machine that sorts and files it. Don’t worry, it checks the back seat for forgotten Chihuahuas and relatives and it is carefully programmed to give you back the car you parked. (I checked, hoping I might be onto an upgrade.)</p>\n\n	<p>There are four levels of parking below street level, 95 cars, with the stacker saving about a third of conventional parking space requirements. One of the Cross Street shops has been given a window looking into the stacker. It’s not often architects are that proud of their parking.<br />\nThe interesting thing about this development is that here, hard-nosed commercialism comes up against individuality and careful design and construction. The developers, Samson Corp, are also responsible for many other singular and enduring developments such as D72, Axis, Site 3 and Cumulus, all of which are successful and well-liked additions to the city. Ironbank is clearly not a result of experimentation or a fanciful rush of blood to the head. It is the result of experience. <br />\nGood clients make good buildings. Samson have sought out architects who are competent and able to achieve projects such as this and <span class=\"caps\">RTA</span> Studio have an excellent portfolio, particularly with Samson, of rejuvenating fading commercial buildings. Buildings don’t just arrive through some magical process and it takes clients with the initial vision and understanding to be able to initiate (and fund) them. Richard Naish of <span class=\"caps\">RTA</span> says Samson led the project, supporting its unconventionality and, at times, asking them to go further, to try harder. These buildings are not short-term investments. Payback comes from point of difference and quality. Special spaces allow for higher rentals and stable tenancies.</p>\n\n	<p>Although each floor of each tenancy is a single lettable space, interesting things happen. The differing elevations and orientations deliver views from the distant Waitakeres to adjacent roofscapes that continually surprise as one moves through the building. Far from being insular as one might expect, each tenancy looks (at a civil distance) into, onto and up to each other creating a feeling of community, far more than would occur on a subdivided floorplate.</p>\n\n	<p>Within each floor is a service tower, wilfully non perpendicular, serviced with the obligatory solar-heated water and decorated with an unexpected embossed wallpaper of an Edwardian pattern. This pattern is repeated in the perforated ceiling panels and stamped into aluminium sheeting which is used vigorously and in a non-Edwardian way as a soffit lining. A sly nod to Karangahape Road’s heritage. </p>\n\n	<p>As the mention of solar water heating hinted at, this building is green. The building has a low embodied energy, rusting weathering steel replaces paint, and there are environmental strategies in place that no doubt are a good thing, but what I like is that they are not overt. Too often green equals ugly, but not here. Solar panels roughing up the roof line are the most obvious while natural cross ventilation (very Edwardian) is the nicest. </p>\n\n	<p>Ironbank is brave and different but above all it is sound. Stripped of its frills the planning is clear and considered and it is exhilarating to be in. We cannot expect all new commercial buildings to be as daring or as extravagant as this but if they get even half the care and design attention that Ironbank has been given, Auckland will be a better place. Supercity take note. </p>','','','/images/783.jpg','mag-article','Issue-52',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','iron-giant','','','','','','','','','','','be96a3d1fbbc746f3184c11ee31f0a50','2009-09-29'),(351,'2009-09-30 06:22:38','andre.kini','2009-09-30 06:22:38','andre.kini','Circus Performer','','<txp:if_individual_article>\r\nWords by Graeme Burgess\r\nPhotography Simon Devitt\r\n</txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\n*A new house in Orakei, Auckland by Hillery Priest architects impresses the crowds with a few well-honed tricks.*\r\n\r\nA morning at the circus. How decadent and surreal, particularly on a sunny weekday morning. This is not, however, the old school circus of sawdust, tents and carni-folk, instead this is the town-planned version. Fenton Circus, a wide circle of grass ringed with a loping road and suburban houses, was created in the 1930s as a focal point of the planned State Housing development of Orakei, the ‘people’s’ housing poised above what, even then, was Auckland’s best address: Paratai Drive. Now the state has sold up and there is barely a trace of the once regimented public housing; it has gone or been subsumed by layers of additions and alterations. If there are any carni-folk left here they were very successful ones and are now retired. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"780\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nThe circus has become a parade of self-expression, the grand houses have entered the ring, and have begun to respond to the scale of the place and to sigh and applaud at the amazing views. This is an extraordinary environment, partly because like the rest of Auckland, it possesses natural beauty, the orientation and the outlook is breathtaking, but also the plan of the suburb is so strong and, in a New Zealand context, so outlandish, that the old ordering of the place becomes a key part of the performance. The circle of the road connects the houses and the broad green lawn at the centre provides a self-conscious public realm for daily life. The lawn was empty when I visited but that was a mid-week morning so no kids playing footy, no neighbourhood picnics, no smooching lovers… I hope that happens, a green expansiveness like this looked too good to go to waste.\r\n\r\nSo what about the performers? This circus is so big it demands large scale. From the remnants of the 1930s housing lost around the edges one can imagine that the state houses were not enough to reinforce this place and that there has always been a disjunction between the scale of the arena and the scale of the private world around it. In the last few decades the circus has begun to bulk up, private ownership has changed the scene, the houses have taken steroids and begun to express themselves… the circus has become a theatre for display!  So far the show is pretty disappointing – a few badly made-up clowns, the odd show pony, certainly no tattooed ladies but – tah dah! – there is a handsome bearded lady, or is it a strongman?\r\n\r\nThe house I came to visit, designed by Hillery Priest Architects, is the only house on Fenton Circus that comes close to responding to the environment. It stands out by being bold and by being bold it expresses itself in the arena. It is theatrical in a friendly manner, strong in form and appearance but not intimidating; imagine a wink from the bearded lady.  \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"778\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nFrom the street it has a strong but not overwhelming appearance. It does not turn its back on its audience but rather, it fronts up and flexes its concrete muscle. It is too interesting to intimidate, instead you want to touch it, to feel its fluted concrete walls, to enter the ripple-surfaced door and touch that too in passing. This place is sensual and large, in fact it is hard to forget the large as every part of the building declares its size and strength, even the joinery would challenge a strongman: “Watch Ivan pull open the three metre door with just one finger!” \r\n\r\nThe huge entry door is surrounded by glass and behind the glass the fluting of the concrete is echoed by the folds of two-storey diaphanous curtains. Through the door is the clearly planned interior, a finely articulated sequence of living areas on the ground floor opening out from around the spine of the entry hallway. From the lobby a crisp stair rises in a single bound to the equally well-planned private rooms above.\r\n\r\nThe plan is rewarding, it is simple but effective, no fancy tricks are required as the house unfolds before you. The different spaces are all connected to the central pathway, all the living spaces are folded to the north-facing garden. From the terrace, the concrete post and beam structure steps into the grand end room, flexing and showing off. Slightly overblown, posing for effect, this could be overwhelming but it is not. The spaces feel carefully considered and friendly family spaces. The big moments, and there are many of them, just happen, the view, the outdoor pool, the garden terraces, these are all an integral part of the design and fit effortlessly.\r\n\r\nThe small moments in and around the house also reward the audience. This is a sensuous environment filled with light, sometimes from unexpected angles, and constructed (in the design sense) with care. The strongest of these is the deep long reveal in the ceiling above the kitchen bench that floods this area in light and creates a focal point at the end of the entry hallway. The bench itself is a sculptural object almost animate (it has a soulmate crouching into the yard outside, a giant Corbousian concrete bench seat). The ceilings are punched to create light in the bathrooms too; here the holes are small and deliberately placed over vanity areas or in showers. Slot windows are also used to throw light into spaces from the side washing the tiled walls rather than creating views. I liked that immensely. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"780\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nContrasting surfaces reward the hand and eye, the curtains again play a key role as enormous veils over the windows creating an effect both tantalising and bold.  Every plane has been carefully considered. Most surfaces are plain and flat, intersecting crisply at the edges but special areas have been highlighted with texture, materials, and colour as in the thin, stained timber ballustrades or the rose head nail deck fixings. The contrast of the ordinary with fine craft is a theme running through the house, a type of  “construction jewellery”. \r\n\r\nThere were surprises: the widest, lowest gas fire I have ever seen, fitted into the David White-made cabinetry in the living area; and a vivid red wallpapered wall, chosen by interior designer Ann Motion, at the end of the living room.\r\n\r\nAfter the performance what was most memorable was the refinement of the plan and the manner in which a place of this scale in this situation was so relaxed – the bearded lady comfortable with herself and delighted to be on show.','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\nWords by Graeme Burgess<br />\nPhotography Simon Devitt<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>A new house in Orakei, Auckland by Hillery Priest architects impresses the crowds with a few well-honed tricks.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>A morning at the circus.

Bright, spacious, and curated with a careful eye, Aroha Lamour has a love for design that is carried through every part of this small business. The welcoming and approachable feel of the store permeates through the entire space. The small family-run shop reminds one of provincial mom-and-pop stores that use to line the main streets of small towns.\r\n\r\nThis is no typical small town store, however. Aroha Lamour stocks the country’s top labels in fashion, homeware, graphic prints, babywear, lighting and furniture that would fit in the most cosmopolitan of cities. Outside of a big centre, a storeowner may be tempted to stock cheaper brands, and while there is a consideration for a range of budgets (and some amazingly good buying) there is no cheapening the stock. It is simply the best collection of fashion labels I’ve come across, each sharing a similar high quality and beauty as chosen by Melaina Karaitiana who has an uncanny ability to find pieces that are both original and unusual but wearable and comfortable. This isn’t about occasion dressing here; rather, as with all the design stocked in the shop, it looks at design as an integral, everyday part of a good life.\r\n\r\nOutside of fashion, the stock is a mix of products from local designers (as you will see in our Hawke’s Bay profile pg 114, there are a lot to choose from), designers around the country, and work that owner Rakai Karaitiana has created himself. \r\n\r\nWhen you walk in you are greeted like an old friend, even if it is your first time. Design is integral to the store and the staff is all a mix of designers and artists. The store is surprisingly large: huge ceilings and a large floor area subtly separated into smaller sections with different stock in each. At the back of the store, a large screen-printing press is on display and this is where Rakai screen prints the graphic prints that hang along the walls, or will print a t-shirt for you while you wait. Rakai also designs objects. Continuing that push to use local contractors, he has been experimenting with the possibilities of water cutting, creating cut-outs of Crown Lynn plates. He also designs fonts and updates the store’s design blog. \r\n\r\nToo often design stores can be intimidating, glossy and unfriendly dens of high-end design, or crammed with kitsch, funny and lewd knick-knacks that don’t seem particularly well designed at all. Aroha Lamour is neither intimidating nor trite. Everything in this store is beautiful and well-designed.

This year alone, the talented Wellington designer has opened her first stand-alone store, gotten married, shown one Winter collection for her third season at New Zealand Fashion Week, and designed a second, different Winter collection for the prestigious New York Fashion Week, where she has been invited to show early next year. Does she find time to sleep? “Yep!” she declares, with customary good cheer, before amending herself, “Not much – there is the odd sleepless night. It has been quite mad. We’ve pretty much taken on every challenge possible. It’s been very testing but you get the real highs with that, which are really exciting.”\r\n\r\nWhen Urbis spoke to Owen, she and her new husband (furniture designer James Whitta, who contributed to the design of Owen’s Wellington boutique) were in the thick of planning for New Zealand Fashion Week and just days away from flying to New York to meet with event organisers and showrooms in preparation for her debut next February. Owen was looking forward to meeting with a key contact in America’s tough market – Kiwi model-turned-fashion-journalist Kathryn Neale, a staffer at US Vogue, and perhaps more crucially, daughter-in-law to Vogue’s editor Anna Wintour, the most powerful woman in the fashion world.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"793\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nChances are that Owen’s sophisticated, sculptural pieces will catch the eye of the American media and public alike. At her first New Zealand Fashion Week show in 2007, she presented a range of slimline, fluidly draped, garments in futuristic fabrics and a monochromatic palette. Since then, she has been turning out collections that are dreamlike with a consistency that’s machinelike. This year she’s been investigating the notion of British etiquette: “dressing for different times of the day, the history of gentlemen’s tailoring.” Her Spring/Summer 09 collection gave us a taste of it, with structured blazers, layered waistcoats and plays on the cravat concept. Her next two shows promise to develop that concept further: “Very ‘British aristocracy’, lots of British and Italian wools, lots of tweeds, some stripes.” All put together, no doubt, with a full measure of care.

ABSOLUT COLLABORATION involves some of New Zealand’s most innovative artists, spanning several art disciplines. Each artist has been asked to interpret the soon-to-be revealed ABSOLUT VODKA TV campaign Anthem, directed by internationally renowned Rupert Sanders, and to then translate this into their particular art form. The results will then be displayed within and around a giant inflatable cube. Enormous word-art painted by artists from The Cut Collective will fence the perimeter of the park, spelling out the ABSOLUT anthem while selected artists have created their own interpretations of each word in the Anthem: ’Doing things differently leads to something exceptional.’ \r\n\r\n >> Visit \"www.absolut.com//\":http://www.absolut.com/ <br />\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.

Audi Drives Urbis Design Day !(imgleft)/images/827.jpg!\r\n\r\nUrbis is proud to introduce Audi New Zealand as its premium sponsor for Urbis Designday 2010.  The luxury vehicle manufacturer has an award-winning design history, with progressive and sleek design values being at the heart of its success in the New Zealand market.\r\n\r\n“Urbis Designday and Audi are a perfect fit,” says Dane Fisher, General Manager of Audi NZ. “Both are a celebration of the power of pure design.” Audi will present a new vehicle as part of the partnership. “We’ve got an exciting new model, due for release in February 2010, that was developed with the creative professional in mind. It’s a vehicle that makes a design statement and stands up in terms of both functionality and performance,” says Fisher. \r\n\r\n >> Visit \"Urbis magazine\":http://www.urbismagazine.com <br />\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nh4. Bob Steiner Giveaway !(imgright)/images/828.jpg!\r\n\r\nBob Steiner is perhaps best known for his small, brightly coloured ceramic fantails, but produces a range of beautiful pieces inspired by native flora and fauna. He recently moved his business to a larger studio in Auckland\'s Avondale to cope with the still-growing demand for his work and to celebrate, is giving away a set of three ceramic flowers (RRP $225). Pictured are one Star Whiteywood and two Ruapehu Mahoe flowers, each measuring 160mm in diameter and 60mm in depth. \r\n\r\nEmail sam.eichblatt@agm.co.nz with the address of Steiner\'s new studio, with \'Bob Steiner giveaway\' in the subject line.

Light Up the Dark  !(imgleft)/images/829.jpg!\r\n\r\nFinally, a plan to celebrate the Rugby World Cup in 2011 we can get behind. Pattersons Associates were joint winners of the open section of the Cavalier Bremworth Award for unbuilt architecture last week, with a plan to transform Auckland\'s harbour bridge with new technology lighting. We like the idea of achieving a grand impact with minimal environmental interference. We also like that it highlights the engineering scope of one of the city\'s finest architectural features.

Take Your Time !(imgright)/images/830.jpg!\r\n\r\nIcelandic-Danish artist Olafur Eliasson captured the UK public\'s imagination in 2003 with The Weather Project, which took a subject close to the heart of every Englishman and created a hazy landscape in the Tate Modern\'s vast Turbine Hall, lit by a giant sun-like shape. Visitors, a reported 2 million of them, reacted by lying on their backs underneath it, waving their arms and legs at the reflective ceiling like stunned ants. Clearly not a man who thinks on a small scale, in 2008 Eliasson created the four giant man-made New York City Waterfalls along the East River at a cost of USD$15.5 million of privately raised funds. And now he\'s coming to Sydney. Take your time: Olafur Eliasson, will open at the MCA in Sydney on 10 December and runs until 11 April next year. \r\n\r\n >> Visit \"Museum of Contemporary Art\":http://www.mca.com.au/default.asp?page_id=11&content_id=4820  <br />\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nh4.

I completed a BA (Hons) in Furniture and Product Design at Nottingham Trent University in 2000 and then an MA in Furniture Design at Buckinghamshire Chilterns University.\r\nAfter completing my Masters in 2002 I opened Northwards Design Studio in London and began working for a number of different companies including Innermost, Dark, Marset and Habitat, where I worked for six months under Tom Dixon.\r\nIn 2006 I organised and curated the sustainable design exhibition and collective, TEN. I’m currently a Lecturer in Industrial Design at Massey University in Wellington.\r\n\r\n*How do you turn an idea into a product?*\r\nMy design process is different for each project. If it is a self-driven project, then often this is just a development of an idea that has been bubbling away for a while. When working with clients, it depends on the company and their requirements. I like to work full size quite quickly, so mock-ups and prototypes are important to get an idea of form, size and scale. My process is generally fluid, from sketching, prototyping, engineering drawings and computer- generated visuals, there are no hard and fast rules – unless I make them!\r\n\r\n*What has been a highlight in your design career so far?*\r\nProbably the TEN project. This began as a reaction to all the ‘greenwashing’ that was out there about sustainable design. \r\nI wanted to get a group of designers together that design objects, and get them to respond to the issues of sustainable design with three-dimensional ideas. This won two awards at 100% Design in London in 2006, including Best Contribution to Show. Since then, and in my absence, the project has happened every year. In 2008 we worked with the Crafts Council in the UK, and retailer TwentyTwentyOne, and we have just finished TEN XYZ, which uses digital technologies as a tool to ask questions about sustainable design and design practice in general.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"841\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*You teach design as well as practise. How does this influence your work?*\r\nI think, more than anything, it keeps me fresh. I feel that I learn a lot more than if I was just in my own studio, on my own. I have the best of both worlds in a way. I am still very active with clients, and producing my own design work, yet I am also learning from my students and colleagues about facets of design in which they are experts. Since being in New Zealand, I have learnt a lot about design research in its many forms. I’m looking forward to developing this and seeing the results filter into my commercial work.\r\n\r\n*What are you trying to achieve with your designs?*\r\nThe best end result for the particular brief. As I develop as a designer, my perspective of what design should and could be has evolved. I am growing more interested in design as a critique of contemporary culture – objects that consider and question how we are developing as human beings. My commercial work has always been about objects with value. I like developing objects and a body of work that has integrity, and is not driven by fashion, but by function, economics and aesthetics. \r\n\r\n*Do you dabble in design outside of furniture?*\r\nI regard myself as a creative person. I don’t like to pigeonhole myself.

I completed a BA (Hons) in Furniture and Product Design at Nottingham Trent University in 2000 and then an MA in Furniture Design at Buckinghamshire Chilterns University.<br />\nAfter completing my Masters in 2002 I opened Northwards Design Studio in London and began working for a number of different companies including Innermost, Dark, Marset and Habitat, where I worked for six months under Tom Dixon.<br />\nIn 2006 I organised and curated the sustainable design exhibition and collective, <span class=\"caps\">TEN</span>. I’m currently a Lecturer in Industrial Design at Massey University in Wellington.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>How do you turn an idea into a product?</strong><br />\nMy design process is different for each project. If it is a self-driven project, then often this is just a development of an idea that has been bubbling away for a while. When working with clients, it depends on the company and their requirements. I like to work full size quite quickly, so mock-ups and prototypes are important to get an idea of form, size and scale. My process is generally fluid, from sketching, prototyping, engineering drawings and computer- generated visuals, there are no hard and fast rules – unless I make them!</p>\n\n	<p><strong>What has been a highlight in your design career so far?</strong><br />\nProbably the <span class=\"caps\">TEN</span> project. This began as a reaction to all the ‘greenwashing’ that was out there about sustainable design. <br />\nI wanted to get a group of designers together that design objects, and get them to respond to the issues of sustainable design with three-dimensional ideas. This won two awards at 100% Design in London in 2006, including Best Contribution to Show. Since then, and in my absence, the project has happened every year. In 2008 we worked with the Crafts Council in the UK, and retailer TwentyTwentyOne, and we have just finished <span class=\"caps\">TEN</span> <span class=\"caps\">XYZ</span>, which uses digital technologies as a tool to ask questions about sustainable design and design practice in general.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"841\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>You teach design as well as practise. How does this influence your work?</strong><br />\nI think, more than anything, it keeps me fresh. I feel that I learn a lot more than if I was just in my own studio, on my own. I have the best of both worlds in a way. I am still very active with clients, and producing my own design work, yet I am also learning from my students and colleagues about facets of design in which they are experts. Since being in New Zealand, I have learnt a lot about design research in its many forms. I’m looking forward to developing this and seeing the results filter into my commercial work.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>What are you trying to achieve with your designs?</strong><br />\nThe best end result for the particular brief. As I develop as a designer, my perspective of what design should and could be has evolved. I am growing more interested in design as a critique of contemporary culture – objects that consider and question how we are developing as human beings. My commercial work has always been about objects with value. I like developing objects and a body of work that has integrity, and is not driven by fashion, but by function, economics and aesthetics. </p>\n\n	<p><strong>Do you dabble in design outside of furniture?</strong><br />\nI regard myself as a creative person. I don’t like to pigeonhole myself. I’ve designed furniture, products, lighting, homeware and spatial schemes, as well as curating, project management, writing and teaching.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"843\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Whose design work do you admire?</strong><br />\nI have been reading a lot about Bruno Munari recently.

In France, the country house is celebrated for its link with traditional French living but there is often a struggle with how this sense of tradition translates into contemporary architecture. Simultaneously, though paradoxically, the country offers freedom, an escape from the sometimes suffocating conventions and etiquettes of the city. Architecture in country or holiday homes often must try to resolve opposing ideals – the releasing of bonds and a tightening of bonds. \r\n\r\nThis modern country house designed by French architects Caroline Barrès and Thierry Coquet of Barrès Coquet Architects, succeeds due to tight-roping between those two extremes. While its form and materials gives it an avant-garde dynamic, its planning doesn’t step outside of the norm,  creating a house that feels familiar despite its many unusual elements.\r\n\r\nChâteau influences or anything that immediately springs to mind as you utter ‘French Country Home’ have been abandoned in this modern house. Instead of overt architectural references, this house connects with a lineage of rural French building through more subtle relationship dynamics. Considerations for family, landscape and \r\na certain joie de vivre are apparent throughout the house in the spatial arrangements, connections between interior and exterior and a fastidiousness of style.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"847\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nRather than a hipped or Mansard roof of more traditional French architecture, this house cuts a dramatic shape into the landscape with its triangle form. The 45° sloped side works both as wall and roof. The vertical elevation, and, more typically, the sloped elevation as well, are kept resolutely flat. Apart from a deck that cantilevers from the mezzanine living area, the face is abruptly level. The detailing of the windows continues this seamless plane so that their reflective surface almost seems to merge with the reflective aluminium, again underscoring a sense of shape and form above all other conventions. Its flatness is, perhaps even more so than the triangle shape, the house’s most pointed move away from tradition. The slick wall \r\nis fortress-like, with such an abandonment of ornament that it feels unnatural. While many houses try to soften themselves to make them more homely and accommodating, this house relishes its machine-like aloofness.\r\n\r\nThis sense of measured detachment is continued through to its placement on the site. Positioned delicately on a gently sloping hill, the house barely seems to touch the ground. The front (vertical) elevation is suspended off the ground while the rear apex of the triangle lightly pin-points the ground, but again doesn’t reinforce any sense of structure or weight bearing. The effect is to further enhance the shapeliness of the triangle shape – in its apparent lightness the form disconnects from ‘house’ and reads more like a toy block or discarded factory piece. That ambiguity of scale is part of what gives depth and interest to this project. The slightly elevated connection between the lower floor and the grounds also subtly reinforce that château-image of the building providing a pedestal with promenading stairs down into the gardens, both a moment of survey and detachment. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"848\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nThough the exterior gesture is grand, the interior is relatively contained. The tight plan puts all the living and communal areas on the top floors while bedrooms tuck into the ground level. The bedrooms then enjoy a sense of containment while the living areas make the most of the panoramic views and take advantage of the energetic spatial arrangement created as the slope of the roof demarcates the edge of the rooms. The benefit of the triangle form is not any extra space in plan – if anything, this form is constraining – but rather the height created with the triangle creates a sense of sumptuousness that belies the somewhat austere cladding materials and finishes. The high stud, especially in the living areas, is also an important, albeit subtle, connection back to the traditional French Country House with its generous ceilings, and can even recall the attic-like upper level spaces that open out from inside the slope of zinc roofs. \r\n\r\nThe triangle form is somewhat deceiving. The house proper is a rather traditional layout on two rectangular levels, and the awkward leftover space as the angled wall/roof pulls down towards the ground is instead not part of the house, but forms a sort of car (or rather scooter) port. This seamless integration of function with a strong articulation of space again shows the architect’s focus and thoroughness.\r\n\r\nIndustrial aluminium cladding has been used both outside and in. The careful arrangement of the metal never veers into garage-mode, however, but rather the polished sheen creates a sense of glamour and again, luxury, confusing the assumed notions around materials. The vertical elevation feels, from the inside, that the entire surface is window, such is the brightness, but in actual fact, there are only narrow strip windows while the majority of the surface is clad in vertically patterned acrylic which lets light in but offers privacy from its muted distortion. From the exterior, the acrylic melds seamlessly with the shiny aluminium, continuing the clear articulation of the vertical face.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"849\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nThe potential difficulty with a house that takes such a strong form is that its shell remains detached from the life lived inside. The interior furnishings in this house are key in transforming this country house from a cold, industrial lean-to, to a vibrant family home. Vibrant is obviously a term the clients took to heart. The house is filled with a carefully edited selection of contemporary design furniture. Many of the key pieces are in bright colours, but they keep to modern, linear forms that reflect the architecture.\r\n\r\nArchitects Barrès and Coquet have managed to acknowledge the often conflicting desires and roles of the rural escape and have successfully translated this into a built form. These unusual combinations ­– a juxtaposition of luxurious and functional materials, the unflinching hard-edged triangle shape hosting a cozy family unit or untraditional forms that reference the traditional – show their appreciation of balance. Familiarity and surprise happen in equal doses, exactly what you’re after on holiday. u\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\nWords by Nicole Stock<br />\nPhotography e.saillet@GAP Interiors<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Barrès Coquet architects use a dynamic shape to reinterpret the French country house.</strong></p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"846\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>The country house is defined in contrast to what it is not – the city house.

Designed in 2003, this house looked as though it might be confined to the blueprints due to an extended five-year clash with the Auckland Regional Council (ARC) for consent. The project’s dramatic site was its blessing as well as its curse. \r\n\r\nWhy so much trouble? Well, the site, a 200 hectare working sheep farm that extends prow-like along a peninsula near Muriwai beach on Auckland’s West Coast – the house’s grand podium – was also a waving red flag. Its isolation and location makes the land here particularly precious and when a site is so valued, fears abound about its potential misuse.\r\n\r\nLand has always been contentious. Perhaps especially so here when many key touchstones of our history are tied irrevocably to the land. While the Treaty’s conflicting assumptions about ownership would be the most obvious example, more recently, debate has swirled around the parallel interests of the public – represented by councils charged with protecting ‘significant landscapes’ – and the private owners \r\nof property. \r\n\r\nAlthough on private land – the family-owned sheep farm – the house can be glimpsed from the public coastal track between Bethells Beach (Te Henga) and Goldies Bush and this (assumed damaging) visual effect is what created difficulties. Though the Rodney District Council issued a resource and building consent for the house, it was the ARC who stepped in late in the process (half the house had already been built) intent on demolishing the house. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"851\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nWrangling, then, followed in the courts, but as the photos clearly show, the house eventually went ahead. I’m biased towards good architecture, I suppose, but these images don’t exactly paint a picture of detrimental visual effect. Perhaps if anything, the house, especially seen from afar (as in the opening spread) melts into the cliff to be an almost invisible shadow in a farm valley. \r\n\r\nPatterson’s original concept for the house was drawn directly from these cliffs – that distinctly European form: the castle on the hill. The castle, in particular its spot on an exposed high site, lends itself easily to romantic notions of stone forts, though Patterson explains this house is “a fort protecting from the elements rather than the hordes”. (Though it seems the house was not immune from battles over its parcel.) However, at the same time as using the castle motif as a central idea, a New Zealand identity was always maintained, here again, because of the genuine New Zealandness of this site, but also in part from ideas pulled from works of artists like Gordon Walters. \r\n\r\nWalters is most well known for his almost op-art contemporary ‘koru’ motif works but before those iconic works, Walters did a series of abstract plan or map-like paintings. Within the canvas, various sized rectangles sit within a field with the occasional squiggle, that, at least to someone with an architectural bent, seem distinctly diagrammatic, concerned with spatial arrangements, composition, and proportion. \r\nThe roof elevation, a series of interlocking rectangles, one a negative, the absence filled with the courtyard, are defined with heavy parapets delineating their shapes further and giving the roof a formal, drawn quality. The roof is like a built drawing. \r\nYou first see the house from above, as you drive down the hill towards the house. The roof is usually a forgotten, or at least hidden, amalgamation of all the extraneous stuff that is shunted out of site. Here, the roof is as Andrew Patterson explains, “the fifth elevation” as carefully organized and considered as any of the other elevations.\r\nThe dark-stained cedar and care in the texture and patterning of the materials throughout the house lend a sculptural quality, though with the rigid linearity of the plan, work perhaps like that of Bret Graham with his traditional black Maori etchings and sharp contemporary, scientific forms.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"852\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nAlong the landward, eastern façade that you first approach, the elevation is elegantly clad with flat strips of black timber. To relieve any potential of monotony and enliven the façade, the cladding changes to deeper, ridged strips within the front door and the end of the courtyard. Though still maintaining a strong sense of verticality, shadow is created with a deep board and batten cladding, which further disintegrates over the doorway to a gate-like arrangement. Likewise, the wall of the courtyard, completely closed off at first, can be opened with a series of pivoting doors that again maintain this vertical groundedness with the columns, but offer up a sense of transparency as the entire elevation changes from dark fortress wall, to a welcoming invitation.\r\nInside, black timber is also used, but given a more delicate and refined treatment. Walls clad in strips of vertical timber use a similar language from the exterior but the waxy finish brings to mind a well-worn sheen like old wooden steps seen in a castle. Another castle nuance, or perhaps again that careful thoughtfulness about texture, are the rose-head nails that punctuate each board almost like armour. A similar treatment is given to the kitchen where the appliances can be hidden behind large doors. Even the kitchen sink is hidden in a client-driven desire for clear surfaces. The tap is actually a shower faucet that coils inside the island’s sink.\r\n\r\nThe courtyard is designed with as much care as the other rooms in the house, indeed this space was considered a room. Enclosed on all sides and with an outdoor fireplace and connection to the adjoining dining and kitchen area, this is as much a living space as either the formal living room or the family room, it just happens to be open to the elements. That negative space, so key in the composition of the plan as seen in the roof elevation, is also essential once inside this house. It keeps the house from feeling too solid or thick and instead allows for an easy visual transparency between spaces. The entry hall, the living and kitchen and the family room all look out into this space and so there are views across and through to other areas of the house. The pool, too, another layer of graphic rectangles, also adds vibrant colour and reflects light into the rest of the house; the playful rippling of the water adds animation to the black surfaces which could otherwise have been matte and dull. u\r\n\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\nWords by Nicole Stock<br />\nPhotography Simon Devitt<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>A striking cliff-top site west of Auckland was both bane and boon for this dark and handsome Patterson Associates-designed house.</strong></p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"850\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>This house, designed by Andrew Patterson of Patterson Associates, could have easily been a castle in the sky – a daydream. Designed in 2003, this house looked as though it might be confined to the blueprints due to an extended five-year clash with the Auckland Regional Council (<span class=\"caps\">ARC</span>) for consent. The project’s dramatic site was its blessing as well as its curse. </p>\n\n	<p>Why so much trouble? Well, the site, a 200 hectare working sheep farm that extends prow-like along a peninsula near Muriwai beach on Auckland’s West Coast – the house’s grand podium – was also a waving red flag. Its isolation and location makes the land here particularly precious and when a site is so valued, fears abound about its potential misuse.</p>\n\n	<p>Land has always been contentious. Perhaps especially so here when many key touchstones of our history are tied irrevocably to the land. While the Treaty’s conflicting assumptions about ownership would be the most obvious example, more recently, debate has swirled around the parallel interests of the public – represented by councils charged with protecting ‘significant landscapes’ – and the private owners <br />\nof property. </p>\n\n	<p>Although on private land – the family-owned sheep farm – the house can be glimpsed from the public coastal track between Bethells Beach (Te Henga) and Goldies Bush and this (assumed damaging) visual effect is what created difficulties. Though the Rodney District Council issued a resource and building consent for the house, it was the <span class=\"caps\">ARC</span> who stepped in late in the process (half the house had already been built) intent on demolishing the house. </p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"851\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Wrangling, then, followed in the courts, but as the photos clearly show, the house eventually went ahead. I’m biased towards good architecture, I suppose, but these images don’t exactly paint a picture of detrimental visual effect. Perhaps if anything, the house, especially seen from afar (as in the opening spread) melts into the cliff to be an almost invisible shadow in a farm valley. </p>\n\n	<p>Patterson’s original concept for the house was drawn directly from these cliffs – that distinctly European form: the castle on the hill. The castle, in particular its spot on an exposed high site, lends itself easily to romantic notions of stone forts, though Patterson explains this house is “a fort protecting from the elements rather than the hordes”. (Though it seems the house was not immune from battles over its parcel.) However, at the same time as using the castle motif as a central idea, a New Zealand identity was always maintained, here again, because of the genuine New Zealandness of this site, but also in part from ideas pulled from works of artists like Gordon Walters. </p>\n\n	<p>Walters is most well known for his almost op-art contemporary ‘koru’ motif works but before those iconic works, Walters did a series of abstract plan or map-like paintings. Within the canvas, various sized rectangles sit within a field with the occasional squiggle, that, at least to someone with an architectural bent, seem distinctly diagrammatic, concerned with spatial arrangements, composition, and proportion. <br />\nThe roof elevation, a series of interlocking rectangles, one a negative, the absence filled with the courtyard, are defined with heavy parapets delineating their shapes further and giving the roof a formal, drawn quality. The roof is like a built drawing. <br />\nYou first see the house from above, as you drive down the hill towards the house. The roof is usually a forgotten, or at least hidden, amalgamation of all the extraneous stuff that is shunted out of site. Here, the roof is as Andrew Patterson explains, “the fifth elevation” as carefully organized and considered as any of the other elevations.<br />\nThe dark-stained cedar and care in the texture and patterning of the materials throughout the house lend a sculptural quality, though with the rigid linearity of the plan, work perhaps like that of Bret Graham with his traditional black Maori etchings and sharp contemporary, scientific forms.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"852\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Along the landward, eastern façade that you first approach, the elevation is elegantly clad with flat strips of black timber. To relieve any potential of monotony and enliven the façade, the cladding changes to deeper, ridged strips within the front door and the end of the courtyard. Though still maintaining a strong sense of verticality, shadow is created with a deep board and batten cladding, which further disintegrates over the doorway to a gate-like arrangement. Likewise, the wall of the courtyard, completely closed off at first, can be opened with a series of pivoting doors that again maintain this vertical groundedness with the columns, but offer up a sense of transparency as the entire elevation changes from dark fortress wall, to a welcoming invitation.<br />\nInside, black timber is also used, but given a more delicate and refined treatment. Walls clad in strips of vertical timber use a similar language from the exterior but the waxy finish brings to mind a well-worn sheen like old wooden steps seen in a castle. Another castle nuance, or perhaps again that careful thoughtfulness about texture, are the rose-head nails that punctuate each board almost like armour. A similar treatment is given to the kitchen where the appliances can be hidden behind large doors. Even the kitchen sink is hidden in a client-driven desire for clear surfaces. The tap is actually a shower faucet that coils inside the island’s sink.</p>\n\n	<p>The courtyard is designed with as much care as the other rooms in the house, indeed this space was considered a room. Enclosed on all sides and with an outdoor fireplace and connection to the adjoining dining and kitchen area, this is as much a living space as either the formal living room or the family room, it just happens to be open to the elements. That negative space, so key in the composition of the plan as seen in the roof elevation, is also essential once inside this house. It keeps the house from feeling too solid or thick and instead allows for an easy visual transparency between spaces. The entry hall, the living and kitchen and the family room all look out into this space and so there are views across and through to other areas of the house. The pool, too, another layer of graphic rectangles, also adds vibrant colour and reflects light into the rest of the house; the playful rippling of the water adds animation to the black surfaces which could otherwise have been matte and dull. u</p>\n\n','','','/images/850.jpg','mag-article','issue-53',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','black-beauty','','','','','','','','','','','ae53eb55e2504a4e4dab2c34133fc3ce','2009-12-08'),(368,'2010-02-10 13:19:12','nicole.stock','2010-03-30 10:54:10','andre.kini','Sony Ericsson Aino Competition','','*Win a Sony Ericsson Aino Mobile Phone with Docking Station and Wireless Headphones.* !(imgright)/images/896.jpg!\r\n\r\n>> Telecom’s XT powered Sony Ericsson Aino ($999) combines a docking station and wireless headphones with a cell phone into a cohesive and unique design.

The 9h/Nine Hours Capsule Hotel in Kyoto is a practical, albeit slightly unromantic, solution for those who find long-haul travel a painful, sleepless bore. It breaks down guests\' needs into three activities: showering (1 hour), sleeping (7 hours) and getting dressed (1 hour). There\'s no time factored in for minibars and bubble baths, but the rooms do use a Panasonic computerised lighting system to get you to the land of nod and back as quickly as possible. \r\n\r\n >> Visit \"www.9hours.jp\":http://www.9hours.jp\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.

This year features installation art from Angelica Mesiti. _Rapture (Silent Anthem)_, a silent, slow-motion video capturing faces in the crowd at Sydney\'s 2008 event, reveals the ability of music to generate a near-mystical response.

New Design Capital Named !(imgright)/images/871.jpg! \r\n\r\nHelsinki was recently named the 2012 World Design Capital by the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (Icsid). The bi-annual WDC competition began in 2008, and seeks to acknowledge cities which have used design to improve quality of life and become part of a global creative network. Like the first two design capitals, Turin (2008) and Seoul (2010), the Finnish city is not presently synonymous with design innovation but quietly nurtures a solid design pedigree: architects Eliel and Eero Saarinen and Alvar Aalto hailed from Helsinki, and big brands Marimekko, Nokia and elevator manufacturer Kone are based there. \r\n\r\n>> Visit \"World Design Capital 2012\":http://www.wdc2012helsinki.fi/en\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nh4. Springtime in Paris !(imgleft)/images/869.jpg! \r\n\r\nIt seems like only last week we were at the Maison et Objet show in Paris, but the next date for this twice-yearly design fair is already upon us. The next show, running from 22 to 26 January (and 3-7 September 2010 for those who want to plan ahead), showcases the Northern spring-summer collections from a huge range of young talents and established names. Urbis editor Nicole Stock was at the 2009 show – see her report in the current issue of Urbis magazine. \r\n\r\n(Image: Beads pendant lights by Winnie Lui for Innermost)\r\n\r\n>> See \"Maison et Objet\":http://www.maison-objet.com/en\r\n\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nh4.

The rejig has allowed large scale installations such as Bill Cuthbert\'s _Pacific Flotsam_ (pictured) to go on show, and is intended to create \"conversations\" between art of different periods. For example, Rita Angus\' _Cass_ – recently voted New Zealand\'s greatest painting – now hangs adjacent to a contemporary photograph of the same landscape by Peter Peryer.\r\n\r\n(Image © Bill Culbert 2007.

The 9h/Nine Hours Capsule Hotel in Kyoto is a practical, albeit slightly unromantic, solution for those who find long-haul travel a painful, sleepless bore. It breaks down guests&#8217; needs into three activities: showering (1 hour), sleeping (7 hours) and getting dressed (1 hour). There&#8217;s no time factored in for minibars and bubble baths, but the rooms do use a Panasonic computerised lighting system to get you to the land of nod and back as quickly as possible. </p>\n\n &gt;&gt; Visit <a href=\"http://www.9hours.jp\">www.9hours.jp</a>\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n	<h4>I Can See the Music <img src=\"/images/870.jpg\" class=\"imgleft\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"135\" /> </h4>\n\n	<p>On tomorrow, Auckland&#8217;s 17th Big Day Out continues to evolve into a wide-ranging creative event, while keeping the music centre stage.

Given the Turner Prize-winner\'s knack for a visual language that engages public and critics alike, the recent announcement that Gormley will be the Chair of Jury for the Brit Insurance Design Awards 2010 makes sense, in an interesting, lateral thinking kind of way.\r\n\r\n>> For more on the Brit Insurance Design Awards 2010 go to \"Designs of the Year\":http://www.designsoftheyear.com\r\n\r\nFor more on Anthony Gormley, see the February issue of Urbis where we preview his latest foray into design in the NZ International Arts Festival.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nh4.

I prefer to unfurl the canvas – or unhinge the hardtop – before dawn, with the sun poised to warm the horizon. This is when the sound of the engine, the shifting of cogs and the tyres on the tarmac have few other noises to compete with.\r\n\r\nConvertibles do add another dimension to driving but they also pose major engineering and packaging challenges. Weight gain is typically the price the car pays. Maintaining structural rigidity and minimising noise requires extra insulation and body strengthening. This can translate into a little less performance or slightly higher fuel consumption.\r\n\r\nThe latest open-top trickery helps compensate for this. For instance, Mazda engineers have made the MX-5 roadster experience richer by ducting the engine’s breathing noises into the cabin under acceleration. The Mercedes-Benz SLK introduced us to ‘AirScarf’, a seatback system that channels warm air around your neck when it’s cool. And Lexus designers have created a climate control system for the new IS250C that maintains cabin temperatures regardless of whether the roof is open or closed.\r\n\r\nThe IS250C is a new four-seater convertible based on the handsome IS250 sedan. It’s a two-door with an electronic folding roof and a longer (slightly awkward-looking) rear overhang that allows you fit your golf clubs when the roof is stowed in the boot. Push a switch and the transformation from coupé to convertible takes a brisk 20 seconds, but the car must be stationary.\r\nAside from some visibility issues with the roof up, the Lexus is remarkably user-friendly to drive, boasting one of the best turning circles of any mid-sized car, a reversing camera with visual parking guidance and radar-active cruise control.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"891\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nLexus has done everything imaginable to prevent the IS shaking over rutted roads, so it takes a serious bump to make the car shudder. And with the roof up there’s a complete absence of wind rush at motorway speeds, and road and engine noise are also well suppressed. Such refinement is matched by the quality feel of the car. The only downside is that while you get to drive an open-top that still offers an ultra-safe, cocoon-like cabin, the doors weigh a tonne. Also despite several weight-saving measures, performance is not a strong point because the small-capacity V6 could do with more oomph. Just as well it’s silky smooth because it requires plenty of revs to accelerate quickly.\r\n\r\nAnother sun-seeking newcomer is Audi’s (even pricier) S5 cabriolet. Based on the A5, it has the same elegant sheet metal, a weight-reducing canvas top, a supercharged V6 that delivers the power and torque of a V8 and the security of Audi’s quattro all-wheel drive system. An ultra-quick seven-speed automated manual makes gear changes satisfyingly instant and sonorous. The ‘Drive Select’ system results in Jeckyll and Hyde character changes: choose the ‘Dynamic’ mode for all-out sportiness and your casual cruiser stiffens up considerably, barking at traffic as you blast past.\r\n\r\nThere are more sedate engine options in Audi’s A5 cabriolet range, including a petrol 2.0-litre turbo that is to be recommended for its sweet soundtrack and eager performance. There’s also the V6 turbo-diesel that is well proven in Audi sedans and SUVs. Refined, smooth and swift, the 3.0-litre diesel pulls away with 500Nm from just 1500rpm. It’s suitable for cruising or bruising but don’t expect its handling to impress quite as much as the seriously sporting S5.\r\n\r\nAudi is also pestering the supercar elite with a Spyder version of the mid-engined R8 sports car. It will be the maker’s most expensive production car when it goes on sale this year, powered by a 5.2-litre V10. The rear wings feature carbon-fibre reinforcing, and a design feature of the rear deck is two rows of cooling vents for the huge motor. The fabric hood folds away in less than 20 seconds and can be opened or closed at urban driving speeds. Despite a 100kg weight gain \r\n(necessary to improve the roadster’s structural integrity), the R8 Spyder can still reach the speed limit in about four seconds.\r\n\r\nBucking the weight gain trend, Porsche unveiled the new Boxster Spyder at December’s Los Angeles Motor Show. This is a new, regular production model designed to be primarily driven with the roof open and it should hit our roads by mid-year. Low side windows and bulges on the single-piece engine cover combine to create a silhouette reminiscent of the Carrera GT supercar. The Spyder tips the scales at 1275kg to become the lightest sports car in the Porsche range. It’s also the most powerful Boxster variant, with 235kW from a 3.4-litre direct-injection engine. Improved handling results from a lower centre of gravity and tweaked sports suspension.\r\n\r\nTrading a fraction of pace for extra grace, Maserati’s first four-seater cabriolet, the GranCabrio, promises grand touring at its luxurious best. This is the convertible version of the beautiful GranTurismo coupé and it features a folding canvas roof to keep the kilos down and to maintain a link with the maker’s soft-top tradition. Designers also opted for an aluminium bonnet and a boot lid made from a composite material. Maserati insists it has achieved class-leading torsional rigidity in a supremely elegant body.\r\n\r\nAt the other (ie. affordable) end of the market, Fiat is set to introduce the cutest drop-top of all, the 500C. Its electric canvas hood folds back, leaving the windows and side pillars in place. Baring more cheek than a sumo wrestler, it will be a great way for me to create a pre-dawn buzz.\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"881\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>  <strong>Andrew Kerr is converted after reviewing  the latest range of cabriolets on the market this summer.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>I know I’m in the minority but, for me, the best cabriolet weather is not when the sun is shining.

This cultural cross-over could bring to mind all sorts of inappropriate Ranchero adobes or Cape Cod mansions plonked incongruously in the Bay of Islands, yet this house does nothing of the sort. Neither has the architecture taken a listless when-in-Rome… attitude and tried to emulate some indefinable New Zealand architectural aesthetic. The house succeeds because the simple building responds so deftly to the surrounding landscape, but also subtly links with its Australian and American heritage as well, creating a house that’s international without being forcibly so.\r\nThe owners, Fred and Kitty Mann, contacted architect James Grose of BVN Architecture after seeing his work in American shelter magazine Dwell. They were going to be in Auckland the next day and wanted to discuss the possibilities of building a house in New Zealand. Rather serendipitously, Grose, who at the time was working on the commercial Sovereign House project (which subsequently won a Supreme Award in the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) Awards in 2008), was also going to be in Auckland. They met up that afternoon, and the global trifecta came into place. Fred then met Philip Lindesay of Lindesay Construction who built the house.\r\nThe fact that the client’s contacted Grose from seeing his contemporary aesthetic would lend an expectation that they weren’t interested in inserting some American architectype onto foreign soil. As Grose comments, “It’s not at all an American house, [the clients] wanted an experience appropriate to the place. This experience [of the landscape] was what they came here for; not to impose their own cultural landscape here.”\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"886\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nThe beauty and drama of the Bay of Islands landscape would be obvious to anyone, but what Grose noticed with his Australian eyes was its clarity. “The principle differences in the landscape [between Australia and New Zealand] is the strong clarity in the colours and the sky [in New Zealand]. Australia has a more muted colour, there is a blueness to everything from the eucalyptus oil in the air, a haziness. But the light and air in New Zealand is light and crisp; there is a clarity about it,” Grose explains. That appreciation of sharpness was translated into a building that aimed to draw the landscape through the house. “There was a clarity in [the house’s] expression. Edges are very sharp and minimal with a high degree of clarity. It is a very compatible language with the implied structural language of the landscape.”\r\nGrose imagined the house as a simple platform – a veranda – a horizontal line that mimicked the horizon that clearly delineates sea from sky. “It is a primitive idea of what you need to keep yourself safe from the creepy crawlies. It is an almost visceral idea of what it is to occupy built space,” he says. The structure, particularly vertical structures like columns and mullions, were minimised, giving a seamless quality to the way the house, especially the living area and the decks, links with the landscape beyond.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"884\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nThe minimal, skeletal structure of the house invited a suggestion of a “Miesian-Murcutt tradition” in the citation of the house’s recent win of a Local NZIA Award. The conjoint itself hints again at this subtle layering of influences from Australia and America on this Antipodean landscape. Grose acknowledges the influence, but suggests it is more subconscious than deliberate, saying: “I come from the school of that kind of late 20th-century skeletal architectural education.”\r\nInside, the analogy of the veranda means that the plan is very simple in its workings – there is an entry ramp from the car port where one enters directly into the open living and dining area. A corridor runs along one side with the kitchen, study, three bedrooms and two bathrooms all linked off this. Doors are mostly sliding panels, which again implies a simple and minimal idea of habitation. Steel and glass are the main materials used on this house, with a timber floor to give depth and character to that key horizontal element.  “There is a very strong contrast between the primary expression of the grey steel frame and the horizontal frame of the timber and the white walls. The house has been designed to be invisible, well, minimal in its impact. There is a lack of complexity,” Grose says. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"885\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nWith such a limited range of materials, how those materials are used is brought to the forefront. Grose says, “When you make architecture in steel, apart from proportion and the elegance of how the steel members relate to each other, the other key thing is connection. If you don’t get that right, you haven’t got anything right. In this house there is an emphasis on the steel being very flush in its detailing; almost as if made out of continuous material. Again with the idea of the landscape, the structure is unobtrusive. The detailing has not been done to announce or give attention to anything but the landscape.”\r\nThis  house has a clear sense of itself, despite its multiple parentage, and every element has been crisply articulated. But most importantly, it is all about living.

On one side of the rope is the team that believes that an architectural addition should appear to sit obediently alongside the existing building, and, on the other team, those who believe that additions should be distinct from the original. In the game concerning the new additions to Wellington’s City Gallery, those vying for renovations to be distinct from the original won, but did so in a respectful way. From the exterior of the gallery, sitting neatly in a concaved corner at the back of the original 1930s building, the new addition, designed by architect Stuart Gardyne of Architecture+, is very much distinct from the original architecture, but by no means does it feel out of place. \r\nWellington’s City Gallery, which was originally purpose-built as the central public library, is part of the collective of diverse architectural styles that form Wellington’s Civic Square. The original building, which was designed by renowned architecture practice Gummer and Ford in partnership with Messenger Taylor and Wolfe, exudes formality but is simplified with geometrical ornamentation. In the early ’90s, the creation of Civic Square included the construction of a new public library building and the commission for Gardyne to convert the old library into the City Gallery. At that stage, Gardyne explains, “significant design decisions were considered about how to create contemporary gallery spaces within an existing building… we wanted the new work to be obvious, but the old and the new were also to be working together in some way”. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"890\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nGardyne has continued the 1990s concept through to the 2009 additions. The insertion is a geometrical form clad in rusted grated steel. “There were several discussions and challenges made about our decision to use rusted steel,” says Gardyne, “although we believe it has a particularly seductive feel”. The use of steel was also advantageous due to the addition’s tight site, which then required a lightweight construction method; but the steel also portrays a strength that allows it to hold a conversation with the heaviness of the original building. \r\nThe interior renovation project is much more discreet. The large, bright foyer that extends out to form the Russell Hancock gallery at the back of the building has been created by the removal of the cinema, and appears as though it has been that way since the building’s conception. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"888\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nUpstairs in the new addition are two galleries, the Roderick and Gillian Deane gallery – created for the display of contemporary Maori and Pacific art – and the Michael Hirschfield gallery – which exhibits local Wellington art. Again, the transition from old to new is not immediately obvious. Until your eyes are drawn upwards towards the galleries’ ceiling one will not notice the small but merit-worthy architectural moment that Gardyne has designed by elevating the centre of the roof and designing a glazed roof lantern, creating an inlet for natural light to fall on the spaces from above. \r\nBack on the ground level in the new addition, the Denis and Verna Adam auditorium is the interior renovation’s biggest architectural gesture. Gardyne has used detailing as a nod to the original architecture. Rough band-sawn timber batons clad the auditorium where the marks made by the original timber formwork can still be seen. A long slot window along the side of the auditorium creates a view to the exterior of the original building, a reminder that this is an addition. The City Gallery’s renovation sits assertively as a distinct piece of architecture, a brave addition to arguably Wellington’s best architectural precinct, the Civic Square. *u*\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"889\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\n*Yayoi Kusama has a spectacular biography.* A repressed childhood in Japan, escape to New York in the 1960s, infamy and recognition at the centre of the contemporary art world, return to Japan, 20 years spent making art from a psychiatric hospital, a resurgence of international interest in her work, and a triumphal return to the annals of Art History. Traditionally a tempestuous personal life has proven to fast-track an artist to popularity – Van Gogh and Pollock spring to mind here. Biography provides the viewer with easy tools with which to decode art and label otherwise abstract forms with biographical symbolism. The overtly public narratives of Kusama’s life are inextricable from her art and are difficult to escape in her blockbuster show, Yayoi Kusama: Mirrored Years, at the City Gallery Wellington. I found, however, that the strength of Kusama’s work lies outside of these pervasive, tired stories. It is easy to delight in Kusama’s extraordinary patterned environments and reflective surfaces. Her work unfolds most generously when you behave like a child amongst it, rather than a critical adult who reads wall texts and says serious things about psychological illness.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"892\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nThe two extravagant rooms at the core of the exhibition, Dots Obsession – Night (2009) and Dots Obsession – Day (2009), are both optic and experiential treats – even as they inevitably become shabbier as the show wears on. Kusama has said in an interview given in 1999, “Polka dots symbolise disease”. More interesting, and by far more pleasant, is not to imagine oneself moving through the artist’s diseased mind, but rather to enjoy the aesthetic weirdness of these vivid environments, and the heightened physical self-awareness generated by navigating these spaces.\r\nInfinity Mirrored Room – Phalli’s Field, 1965 (1998) similarly makes a tactical assault on both the eye and the body and is the most charged space in this exhibition. When you are ushered into this chamber the mirrored walls replicate your image off into infinity and you experience the bemusing sensation of being able to view your body from innumerable and unexpected angles.

On one side of the rope is the team that believes that an architectural addition should appear to sit obediently alongside the existing building, and, on the other team, those who believe that additions should be distinct from the original. In the game concerning the new additions to Wellington’s City Gallery, those vying for renovations to be distinct from the original won, but did so in a respectful way. From the exterior of the gallery, sitting neatly in a concaved corner at the back of the original 1930s building, the new addition, designed by architect Stuart Gardyne of Architecture+, is very much distinct from the original architecture, but by no means does it feel out of place. <br />\nWellington’s City Gallery, which was originally purpose-built as the central public library, is part of the collective of diverse architectural styles that form Wellington’s Civic Square. The original building, which was designed by renowned architecture practice Gummer and Ford in partnership with Messenger Taylor and Wolfe, exudes formality but is simplified with geometrical ornamentation. In the early ’90s, the creation of Civic Square included the construction of a new public library building and the commission for Gardyne to convert the old library into the City Gallery. At that stage, Gardyne explains, “significant design decisions were considered about how to create contemporary gallery spaces within an existing building… we wanted the new work to be obvious, but the old and the new were also to be working together in some way”. </p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"890\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Gardyne has continued the 1990s concept through to the 2009 additions. The insertion is a geometrical form clad in rusted grated steel. “There were several discussions and challenges made about our decision to use rusted steel,” says Gardyne, “although we believe it has a particularly seductive feel”. The use of steel was also advantageous due to the addition’s tight site, which then required a lightweight construction method; but the steel also portrays a strength that allows it to hold a conversation with the heaviness of the original building. <br />\nThe interior renovation project is much more discreet. The large, bright foyer that extends out to form the Russell Hancock gallery at the back of the building has been created by the removal of the cinema, and appears as though it has been that way since the building’s conception. </p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"888\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Upstairs in the new addition are two galleries, the Roderick and Gillian Deane gallery – created for the display of contemporary Maori and Pacific art – and the Michael Hirschfield gallery – which exhibits local Wellington art. Again, the transition from old to new is not immediately obvious. Until your eyes are drawn upwards towards the galleries’ ceiling one will not notice the small but merit-worthy architectural moment that Gardyne has designed by elevating the centre of the roof and designing a glazed roof lantern, creating an inlet for natural light to fall on the spaces from above. <br />\nBack on the ground level in the new addition, the Denis and Verna Adam auditorium is the interior renovation’s biggest architectural gesture. Gardyne has used detailing as a nod to the original architecture. Rough band-sawn timber batons clad the auditorium where the marks made by the original timber formwork can still be seen. A long slot window along the side of the auditorium creates a view to the exterior of the original building, a reminder that this is an addition. The City Gallery’s renovation sits assertively as a distinct piece of architecture, a brave addition to arguably Wellington’s best architectural precinct, the Civic Square. <strong>u</strong></p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"889\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Yayoi Kusama has a spectacular biography.</strong> A repressed childhood in Japan, escape to New York in the 1960s, infamy and recognition at the centre of the contemporary art world, return to Japan, 20 years spent making art from a psychiatric hospital, a resurgence of international interest in her work, and a triumphal return to the annals of Art History. Traditionally a tempestuous personal life has proven to fast-track an artist to popularity – Van Gogh and Pollock spring to mind here. Biography provides the viewer with easy tools with which to decode art and label otherwise abstract forms with biographical symbolism. The overtly public narratives of Kusama’s life are inextricable from her art and are difficult to escape in her blockbuster show, Yayoi Kusama: Mirrored Years, at the City Gallery Wellington. I found, however, that the strength of Kusama’s work lies outside of these pervasive, tired stories. It is easy to delight in Kusama’s extraordinary patterned environments and reflective surfaces. Her work unfolds most generously when you behave like a child amongst it, rather than a critical adult who reads wall texts and says serious things about psychological illness.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"892\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>The two extravagant rooms at the core of the exhibition, Dots Obsession – Night (2009) and Dots Obsession – Day (2009), are both optic and experiential treats – even as they inevitably become shabbier as the show wears on. Kusama has said in an interview given in 1999, “Polka dots symbolise disease”. More interesting, and by far more pleasant, is not to imagine oneself moving through the artist’s diseased mind, but rather to enjoy the aesthetic weirdness of these vivid environments, and the heightened physical self-awareness generated by navigating these spaces.<br />\nInfinity Mirrored Room – Phalli’s Field, 1965 (1998) similarly makes a tactical assault on both the eye and the body and is the most charged space in this exhibition. When you are ushered into this chamber the mirrored walls replicate your image off into infinity and you experience the bemusing sensation of being able to view your body from innumerable and unexpected angles. As such, you are able to leave Kusama’s tortured life story at the door and simply play in this fantastical construction.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"893\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Even in her painting, a medium not often considered to have a direct physical effect on the viewer, your body is engaged by the work.

The first suburb north of central Melbourne, it combines high-density living with an eclectic range of built forms, says Maynard. “It’s one of those places that is always described as ‘bohemian’. It was important to me to engage with that context, the street art and the interesting buildings – but not by building something that would compete with it.” \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"967\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nHe wanted, at all costs, to avoid building something self-consciously ‘funky’ or obvious.

The practice already has a lot of older buildings in its portfolio. “The challenge is the enjoyable part – you need to spend time understanding older buildings, to start a conversation with them. One thing I hate is seeing an old structure next to a larger newer one. You need to show some respect for established buildings.”\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"968\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nThe north wall was treated as a bonus, he says. It meant they were able to build a much taller than usual space with a three-metre stud (in comparison to the standard 2.4m). Walls were knocked out to lend openness and glazed bi-fold doors were added, blurring the distinction between new and old, inside and outside, courtyard and living room. The new extension contains everything else: bedroom, kitchen, studio, study and car park.\r\n\r\nThe design also turns traditional Antipodean expectations on their head by doing away with a garden. “The owner was OK with giving it up,” says Maynard. “The car park ate up the green space, so instead we created a flexible courtyard space at the centre of the house. You end up outdoors anyway.”\r\n\r\nThe result is a house with multiple personalities – in a good way. As well as the contrast between the original, traditional brick building and the light-filled, contemporary additions, there’s a play between hidden and public areas: an aerial walkway between the two upper levels that is invisible from the ground floor and gives a view over the city; a private study concealed in the mezzanine area, and bathroom windows looking out onto the courtyard that become opaque with the flick of a switch. The new spa is hidden in the courtyard under a deck light enough to be rolled back and forth by one person, one configuration adding extra floor space and revealing the last remaining square of lawn, the other opening up the spa. \r\n\r\n“The aesthetic of the Vader House actually seems unfamiliar to me now that it’s finished,” says Maynard. “I think it’s because of the unusual process. It was different because the brief shifted so dramatically; what was originally concrete then evolved and took on a life of its own.” *u*','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\nWords by Sam Eichblatt<br />\nPhotography Peter Bennets<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>It’s tempting to read a modern-day urban saga between the lines of Andrew Maynard’s Vader House renovation in central Melbourne’s suburb of Fitzroy.</strong></p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"971\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Originally commissioned by a professional couple, the brief – to make substantial alternations to a two-storey brick terraced house – evolved dramatically as it progressed to embrace a series of extra features, requiring Maynard to rethink and rework the plans several times. </p>\n\n	<p>The focus of the project became the central courtyard and entertaining area that now occupies the former back yard, as well as the addition of a new interior car park, a cellar and an outdoor spa. “The brief had everything in it, including the car park for a four-wheel drive.

There is no way around it – it isn’t every house that has one. Not even every superhero lair has one. Though in some ways, that’s what this apartment is: a hidden, secure, fantasy hideaway that every boy of any age can relate to.\r\n\r\nThe brief was simple: owner Nigel Shanks wanted to turn an empty warehouse portion of his commercial building into an apartment that was cool, simple, liveable and modern, but with one big catch – it could be reverted back into commercial property once he no longer wanted to live there.\r\nFor the designer, Shanks chose a tenant from one of his buildings, a tenant who he also happened to have known from school. So it was that Dominic Glamuzina and design partner Aaron Paterson of Glamuzina Paterson found themselves working on a project for their landlord. \r\n\r\nThe space had been used as a factory making sauces for burgers, and the last inhabitant had been a massive aioli vat. It was a ’50s-era standard warehouse with breeze blocks, concrete floor, a nice high roof, simple windows and some ugly bi-fold doors that had been added later. Photos from before the fit-out show the magnitude of what that simple request actually meant. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"978\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nWarehouses have no insulation, they have exposed wires, they don’t have mezzanine floors, and they certainly don’t have fireman’s poles. We’ll come back to the pole later, much as the eye does when in the house, as there are other factors that make this house feel like a lair, a hidden getaway, a place separate from the outside world.\r\n\r\nThere were other design particulars – Shanks likes to travel and therefore likes the house to be secure; he also likes his privacy. To bring this about, Glamuzina Paterson removed the bi-fold doors and replaced them with a breeze block wall – keeping with the unpretentious and workmanlike materials. The effect of the high closed walls and windows situated above human height is to make you feel underground, and removed from the world. But thanks to the use of light and space the apartment manages to feel at once underground and also, quite counter-intuitively, like a loft. \r\n\r\nThe light and shape use that make this so are the two stand-out features for the designers. A design ethic for the firm is to try to create unexpected moments in a house. In this project, it manages this with light. Skylights create a rectangular flow from kitchen to fireman pole, leading the eye down the room and acting as a kind of light carpet for people entering. The pole hatch creates an oval-ish circle that disappears in on itself as it concludes. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"969\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nAnd in perhaps the writer’s favourite feature, a storage solution doubles as a lightbox. The storage lightbox keeps with another theme of the design – taking existing features and making them work. So for the lightbox, the architects used a material in keeping with the pared-back vaguely industrial feel – a fibrelite corrugated opaque sheet. This was put up as a wall in front of the triangular storage space – a space that has ample skylighting, making the background much lighter than the foreground, allowing it to ‘shine’. During the day this triangle gives a clean even light, and at night it radiates with found external light. \r\n\r\nSkylighting also gives the bathroom a sense of space it might not otherwise have achieved – being an enclosed windowless space at the back left of the floorplan, this simple touch again helps lift the building from the feeling of a basement.\r\n\r\nBut if you had to pick the one feature, you’d come back to the pole. Shanks was keen to add the playful touch to the house, but it turns out it isn’t that easy to find one. Glamuzina researched far and wide and ended up abandoning the search for a brass relic from a station in favour of stainless steel. It still came in as one of the pricier elements of the design. It is a fun touch, though it brings more to the apartment than just novelty. If you stand back and look towards the entrance you see the line of the fireman’s pole is echoed by the pole that supports the mezzanine floor.\r\nThis is emblematic of the design: found and chosen features work together in clever and surprising ways. The end effect is almost like an Escher picture, where the perspective becomes impossible as one pole holds and the other mirrors, yet plays against the balance by disappearing up the hatch to the bedroom suspended above.\r\n\r\nAnd in that image you have the apartment: practical, playful, clever and a bit of a hidden secret. *u*','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\nWords by Simon Pound<br />\nPhotography Emily Andrews<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Architectural designers glamuzina paterson convert a factory into a Batchelor pad, complete with fireman’s pole.</strong></p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"970\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>The first thing you notice is the fireman’s pole.

Nicole Stock met with both Pippa and Mark Browne from Louis Vuitton to discuss the exhibition Pippa Blake: Journey.*\r\n\r\nTrish Clark has curated the Journey exhibition at Auckland’s Louis Vuitton store, using pieces from a series of works painted over the past five years.\r\n\r\nThough most well-known in this part of the world as the wife of sailor Sir Peter Blake, since his tragic and untimely death, Blake has made a name for herself in the art world. \r\n\r\nHer connection to the fine arts is not a new hobby, in the 1970s, Blake received a Batchelor of Fine Art in Painting with First Class Honours from the Camberwell School of Art. With her recent reconnection with painting, she has pushed herself further into fine arts study completing post-graduate studies, earning Distinction, from West Dean College, in England. \r\n\r\nThe title of the exhibition ??Pippa Blake: Journey??, comes both from her personal journey to reengage with this creative side of herself, as well as the physical journeys that are illustrated in her work.\r\nPippa Blake: ??Journey??, was on at the Louis Vuitton store in Auckland in March, a partner event to the Louis Vuitton Trophy Auckland sailing event.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"975\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*URBIS: Your work is particularly atmospheric; is a sense of place more important than any specific setting?*\r\nPIPPA BLAKE: All my work is triggered off by something, say for example these, the road paintings. They purely came out of me trying not to paint green landscapes and searching for a way, a voice away from the green landscapes, so actually at the time I was travelling backwards and forwards from the studio. It was actually when I was doing my postgraduate year and at night I was taking lots and lots of colour images as I was driving. I do that a lot. Slightly dangerous. Camera, one hand on the wheel. How good the photograph is doesn’t interest me at all and out of those came these night road paintings. That to me was the sort of mystery of that thing where you’re driving along at night and you have the headlights coming around the corner and [wonder] what is it round the corner. So it’s sort of like what’s there.\r\n\r\n*If someone didn’t know they were called Night Road paintings or hadn’t heard your explanation, people, well, New Zealanders in particular, might assume they’re sea scenes. Is it difficult for people, again New Zealanders in particular, to separate you and your work from the work of your late husband, Sir Peter Blake?*\r\nMy work hasn’t been seen out here so much. I had it exhibited about 10 years ago, had a couple of shows, but my work has changed a lot since then, and in fact I don’t paint about the sea. It’s just that I did this one residency on a ship and a lot of work to do with the sea came out of it, and I had another show years ago which I combined with a photographer and again that became specific to do with the sea. But it’s more a sort of universal sea, not about a particular sea voyage. So in that respect, it’s not really related. What it is related to is the fact that, yeah, we were married for 23 years, I did a huge amount of sailing in that time but also I grew up by the sea so I’ve always had the sea in my blood. But I’m happy for people to interpret them. They’re for the viewer to observe and their imagination to take over.\r\n\r\n*I suppose that’s the beauty of abstract work rather than very pictorial work.* \r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n*Mark, it must be quite exciting for you to be able to bring Pippa over and show her work to New Zealanders who haven’t had the chance to see it for 10 years. Why was this significant for Louis Vuitton?*\r\nMARK BROWNE: Louis Vuitton has had a very, very long association with the Blake family, going back to America’s Cup days and also even in more recent years Pippa has been a close friend of the brand. We were very aware of the work that Pippa has been doing in the world of art and we felt that with the various connections over the years, and in more recent years, that it \r\nwas appropriate to talk to Pippa about exhibiting here again because it’s been 10 years since Pippa exhibited here last. We are running this event on the harbour, the Louis Vuitton Trophy series and we felt that there was a nice connect with Pippa’s work and what she’s doing today with the brand. Louis Vuitton and art have a very strong association – we have exhibited a number of artists’ work in our stores around the world. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"976\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*There’s also a connection between Louis Vuitton and the new extension to the Maritime Museum?*\r\nYes, we played quite a small part in that to be honest. There were a number of parties that were very keen to see a permanent exhibit for Sir Peter Blake and we worked [together with other parties] to build this fund-raising effort to get to a point where a permanent exhibit could be realised. It had been spoken about for a long time and now we have it as part of the Maritime Museum and it’s called Blue Water Black Magic – A Tribute to Sir Peter Blake.\r\n\r\n*So going back to your work, Pippa, when I was looking at some of them originally on the computer screen, they initially reminded me of Turner’s work. Was there inspiration from him, or other artists’ work?*\r\nThe tornado painting actually came out of me doing another residency in West Sussex in Petworth, which is actually where Turner had a studio and had worked in that area. It was a two-month residency working in a barn. I did look at Turner a lot for this particular project so it’s interesting that you mention that.\r\nWhen I was getting into drawing and painting when I was at school when I was 16, we had an amazing art teacher and we looked at Cézanne and Monet and Matisse. They were the people that I really sort of looked at a huge amount, not impressionists but more the post impressionists. Then when I was at art school in London in the early ’70s, abstract expressionism was the way, sort of. To me that’s what really influenced and inspired, so people like Willem de Kooning and Rothko to a certain extent, but more de Kooning and Gorky. \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"980\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\n*Sir Peter had such an interest and a dedication in educating people about the environment. Your paintings seem to have a raw energy and to me, at least, a hint of possible destruction perhaps. Am I just reading too much into them or is there a similar interest in environmentalism?*\r\nI think I’d have to separate it from what Peter did, well except just the fact I’ve  travelled with him. I’ve done a huge amount of travelling and I love, I do love the sea, and I love geographical phenomena. I don’t want to see the world destroyed. And actually some of the works on show are from an apocalyptic series of paintings but they more developed from me taking lots of images of fireworks but also at the same time I watched Apocalypse Now, and I also love the First World War poets like Wilfred Owen, so there’s something to do with destruction in that.\r\n\r\n*It’s interesting that you just made an easy connection between images and poetry. It has been written that you do use a lot of prose and poetry to inform your work and yet throughout, as we’ve just been discussing, your inspiration seems very visual. Does the inspiration for different works come in different ways?*\r\nApocalypse Now was based very much on Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and Heart of Darkness was based on TS Eliot’s The Wasteland so there are links, but on the main I would say I’ve always loved English literature and I read a lot. I just think it’s more one’s life experience that goes into the work and it’s really hard to pinpoint exactly what it is or how or why. When you’re painting, it’s you.\r\n\r\n*www.pippablake.com*\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"981\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>  <strong>Pippa Blake, widow of Sir Peter Blake, was recently in Auckland to exhibit her work at the Louis Vuitton store, timed to coincide with the Louis Vuitton Trophy Series.

With her recent reconnection with painting, she has pushed herself further into fine arts study completing post-graduate studies, earning Distinction, from West Dean College, in England. </p>\n\n	<p>The title of the exhibition <cite>Pippa Blake: Journey</cite>, comes both from her personal journey to reengage with this creative side of herself, as well as the physical journeys that are illustrated in her work.<br />\nPippa Blake: <cite>Journey</cite>, was on at the Louis Vuitton store in Auckland in March, a partner event to the Louis Vuitton Trophy Auckland sailing event.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"975\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong><span class=\"caps\">URBIS</span>: Your work is particularly atmospheric; is a sense of place more important than any specific setting?</strong><br />\n<span class=\"caps\">PIPPA</span> <span class=\"caps\">BLAKE</span>: All my work is triggered off by something, say for example these, the road paintings. They purely came out of me trying not to paint green landscapes and searching for a way, a voice away from the green landscapes, so actually at the time I was travelling backwards and forwards from the studio. It was actually when I was doing my postgraduate year and at night I was taking lots and lots of colour images as I was driving. I do that a lot. Slightly dangerous. Camera, one hand on the wheel. How good the photograph is doesn’t interest me at all and out of those came these night road paintings. That to me was the sort of mystery of that thing where you’re driving along at night and you have the headlights coming around the corner and [wonder] what is it round the corner. So it’s sort of like what’s there.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>If someone didn’t know they were called Night Road paintings or hadn’t heard your explanation, people, well, New Zealanders in particular, might assume they’re sea scenes. Is it difficult for people, again New Zealanders in particular, to separate you and your work from the work of your late husband, Sir Peter Blake?</strong><br />\nMy work hasn’t been seen out here so much. I had it exhibited about 10 years ago, had a couple of shows, but my work has changed a lot since then, and in fact I don’t paint about the sea. It’s just that I did this one residency on a ship and a lot of work to do with the sea came out of it, and I had another show years ago which I combined with a photographer and again that became specific to do with the sea. But it’s more a sort of universal sea, not about a particular sea voyage. So in that respect, it’s not really related. What it is related to is the fact that, yeah, we were married for 23 years, I did a huge amount of sailing in that time but also I grew up by the sea so I’ve always had the sea in my blood. But I’m happy for people to interpret them. They’re for the viewer to observe and their imagination to take over.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>I suppose that’s the beauty of abstract work rather than very pictorial work.</strong> <br />\nYeah.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>Mark, it must be quite exciting for you to be able to bring Pippa over and show her work to New Zealanders who haven’t had the chance to see it for 10 years. Why was this significant for Louis Vuitton?</strong><br />\n<span class=\"caps\">MARK</span> <span class=\"caps\">BROWNE</span>: Louis Vuitton has had a very, very long association with the Blake family, going back to America’s Cup days and also even in more recent years Pippa has been a close friend of the brand. We were very aware of the work that Pippa has been doing in the world of art and we felt that with the various connections over the years, and in more recent years, that it <br />\nwas appropriate to talk to Pippa about exhibiting here again because it’s been 10 years since Pippa exhibited here last. We are running this event on the harbour, the Louis Vuitton Trophy series and we felt that there was a nice connect with Pippa’s work and what she’s doing today with the brand. Louis Vuitton and art have a very strong association – we have exhibited a number of artists’ work in our stores around the world. </p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"976\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>There’s also a connection between Louis Vuitton and the new extension to the Maritime Museum?</strong><br />\nYes, we played quite a small part in that to be honest. There were a number of parties that were very keen to see a permanent exhibit for Sir Peter Blake and we worked [together with other parties] to build this fund-raising effort to get to a point where a permanent exhibit could be realised. It had been spoken about for a long time and now we have it as part of the Maritime Museum and it’s called Blue Water Black Magic – A Tribute to Sir Peter Blake.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>So going back to your work, Pippa, when I was looking at some of them originally on the computer screen, they initially reminded me of Turner’s work. Was there inspiration from him, or other artists’ work?</strong><br />\nThe tornado painting actually came out of me doing another residency in West Sussex in Petworth, which is actually where Turner had a studio and had worked in that area. It was a two-month residency working in a barn. I did look at Turner a lot for this particular project so it’s interesting that you mention that.<br />\nWhen I was getting into drawing and painting when I was at school when I was 16, we had an amazing art teacher and we looked at Cézanne and Monet and Matisse. They were the people that I really sort of looked at a huge amount, not impressionists but more the post impressionists. Then when I was at art school in London in the early ’70s, abstract expressionism was the way, sort of. To me that’s what really influenced and inspired, so people like Willem de Kooning and Rothko to a certain extent, but more de Kooning and Gorky. </p>\n\n	<p><txp:upm_image image_id=\"980\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Sir Peter had such an interest and a dedication in educating people about the environment. Your paintings seem to have a raw energy and to me, at least, a hint of possible destruction perhaps. Am I just reading too much into them or is there a similar interest in environmentalism?</strong><br />\nI think I’d have to separate it from what Peter did, well except just the fact I’ve  travelled with him. I’ve done a huge amount of travelling and I love, I do love the sea, and I love geographical phenomena. I don’t want to see the world destroyed. And actually some of the works on show are from an apocalyptic series of paintings but they more developed from me taking lots of images of fireworks but also at the same time I watched Apocalypse Now, and I also love the First World War poets like Wilfred Owen, so there’s something to do with destruction in that.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>It’s interesting that you just made an easy connection between images and poetry. It has been written that you do use a lot of prose and poetry to inform your work and yet throughout, as we’ve just been discussing, your inspiration seems very visual. Does the inspiration for different works come in different ways?</strong><br />\nApocalypse Now was based very much on Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and Heart of Darkness was based on TS Eliot’s The Wasteland so there are links, but on the main I would say I’ve always loved English literature and I read a lot. I just think it’s more one’s life experience that goes into the work and it’s really hard to pinpoint exactly what it is or how or why. When you’re painting, it’s you.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>www.pippablake.com</strong></p>','','','979','mag-dispatch','Issue-55',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','journey-woman','','','','','','','','','','','d4fde7319990535e6d40e15f061c92ed','2010-03-30'),(391,'2010-03-30 10:50:39','andre.kini','2010-03-30 10:51:15','andre.kini','Hi-Top Fancy','','<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"977\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>  *New Zealand-designed, hand-made sneakers are ToBe the next big thing.*\r\n\r\nSneaker fanatics, here’s one for you.

McQueen&#8217;s Puma collection, the SS10 Vulcanizo Satin Wn’s (rrp $310), blends high fashion with sporting form and function. Puma says that &#8216;power&#8217; is the <span class=\"caps\">DNA</span> of this collection and now, people, the power can be yours. </p>\n\n	<p>To win one of two pairs of shoes (one black and one gray) email urbanism@agm.co.nz with word &#8216;power&#8217; in the subject line.

All the pieces, such as Michael Parekowhai&#8217;s <em>Patriot: Ten Guitars</em> (right) have a musical theme. The other works on display are: Julian Dashper’s <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, Slave Piano’s <em>Slave Pianos (of the Art Cult)</em> and Terry Urbahn’s <em>The Karaokes</em>. The new piece is Ava Seymour’s <em>11 Bars of Oboe</em>.  </p>\n\n	<p>&gt;&gt;<a href=\"http://www.adamartgallery.org.nz\">Adam Art Gallery</a></p>\n\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n	<h4>People in Your Neighbourhood<img src=\"/images/1014.jpg\" class=\"imgleft\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"240\" /></h4>\n\n	<p>The <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/nz.htm\">British Council</a> describes People in Your Neighbourhood (henceforth <span class=\"caps\">PIYN</span>) as its annual showcase of urban diversity. Launched a couple of days ago, <span class=\"caps\">PIYN</span> bunches together street-wise UK urban performers with local talents – Charlie Dark and members of the Urban Soul Orchestra, for example,  alongside locals such as Submariner and David TaayNinh Wright from Electric Wire Hustle (as an aside, check out the Hustle&#8217;s <a href=\"http://prodesign.co.nz/on-record/2010/05/04/\">excellent album art  here</a>). <br />\nExpect looped spoken word and string dynamics, modern urban dance, Vietnamese opera, a Brazilian songstress, livestreaming with cool visuals, and the backing of Trinity Roots rhythm section. <a href=\"http://piyn.net/?cat=11\">Check out the May programme</a> for People in Your Neighbourhood 2010, with workshops and performances in Auckland, Taupo and Wellington.</p>\n\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n	<h4>Nice Cube<img src=\"/images/1017.jpg\" class=\"imgright\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"173\" /></h4>\n\n	<p>Just in time for Mother&#8217;s Day, Glengarry has imported these exclusive Veuve Clicquot Ice Cubes, designed by FA Porsche, which holds four cunningly concealed champagne flutes (and a bottle, naturally). The Ice Cube can chill a bottle of Veuve in 20 minutes flat and keep it at the perfect chill for four hours (despite the fact that in good company a bottle of bubbly might last just four minutes&#8230;). The Ice Cube is a little too rare to give away, but Urbis does have one eco-packaged bottle of Veuve up for grabs. Email urbanism.co.nz with the word Veuve in the subject line to go into the draw. </p>\n\n	<p>&gt;&gt; Visit <a href=\"http://www.glengarry.co.nz\">www.glengarry.co.nz</a></p>\n\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n	<h4>It&#8217;s a Wrap<img src=\"/images/1015.jpg\" class=\"imgleft\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /></h4>\n\n	<p>Milan might be the global home of furniture fashions but a little closer to home is designEX, which details the newest directions, innovations and products to market in contemporary design and interior architecture.

What makes iD stand out is the event’s fostering of ideas and creativity, as seen in the exciting range of fantastical and conceptual pieces that showcased craftsmanship, narrative and materiality. Kiwi designer Roxanna Zamani from Otago Polytechnic was one of the crowd favourites with her delicately folded and layered pieces, while Croatian designer Igor Galas won the Emerging Designer award as well as the Mittelmoda prize, which will allow him to show his work again to an international audience at Gorizia in northeast Italy in one of the world’s most coveted prizes for emerging designers. \r\n\r\nIn a welcome twist, Zamani and fellow Otago Polytechic student Sophie Brooke Hardy have also been chosen as two of just 29 finalists to take part in the Mittelmoda Fashion Award. *urbis*','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1022\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>  <strong>Some of the world’s most innovative fashion is put on show at iD Dunedin Fashion Week.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>Dunedin might just be New Zealand’s fashion capital.

The exhibition comprises two related bodies of works: one is a series of maxims stitched in gold lettering on damask linen; the other is a series of ideas about representation inscribed on brass plaques.</td>\n			<td>\n				<img alt=\"right hand side image\" src=\"http://gallery.mailchimp.com/610116aa23b00d06b2daf717e/images/MLB10lay_the_game_E.jpg\" style=\"border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; padding: 2px; max-width: 240px; clear: right; float: right; width: 200px; height: 209px;\"></td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n\n</div>\n   <!-- /editable -->\n   <div id=\"content3\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding: 2px;\">&gt;&gt; <a href=\"http://www.bartleyandcompanyart.co.nz/artists.php?ID=304&artist=Mary-Louise%20Browne\" style=\"text-decoration: none;color: rgb(156, 207, 78);font-weight: normal;\">&#39;Reify&#39; by Mary-Louise Browne</a><br />\n\n</div>\n   <!-- item with righthand image #3-->\n   <!--paid item-->\n   <div id=\"content2\"><div style=\"border-top: 1px dashed rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 0pt; font-size: 11px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\">\n	Sponsored item</div>\n<!-- editable block --><div style=\"border-top: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px; background-color: rgb(232, 232, 232);\">\n	<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n		<tbody>\n			<tr>\n				<td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">\n					<h2 class=\"paid-heading\" style=\"font-size: 14px;font-weight: bold;color: #000000;font-style: normal;font-family: Helvetica;margin-top: 10px;margin-right: 0;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-left: 0;\">\n						NZ Design on Sale &mdash; Special Preview for Urbanism Readers!</h2>\n				</td>\n			</tr>\n			<tr>\n				<td valign=\"top\">\n					<img alt=\"EssenzeSale!!\" src=\"http://gallery.mailchimp.com/610116aa23b00d06b2daf717e/images/NZ_on_Sale_Urbanism_Graphic.1.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding: 2px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); width: 196px; height: 270px;\"></td>\n				<td valign=\"top\">\n					That&#39;s right, it&#39;s almost sale time at Essenze.

New Zealand-based activewear brand Orca has developed an innovative new fabric called SeaMerino, a world-first blend of ultra-fine New Zealand Merino wool and a seaweed-based fibre called SeaCell. The innovative fibre has been used in Orca&rsquo;s new Restday range of wardrobe basics. When the garments are worn, the active substances in SeaCell are released and work to increase bloodflow, aid skin cell regeneration and quench excess free radicals. They also look cool. Orca has two of these new SeaMerino tops, valued at $179 (short sleeve) and $199 (long sleeve), to give away. <a href=\"mailto:urbanism@agm.co.nz?subject=Orca&body=Name%3A%0A%0AAddress%3A\" style=\"color: #9ccf4e;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: normal;\">Email us</a> with the name of one of Orca&rsquo;s other two Merino ranges (other than Restday).

New Zealand-based activewear brand Orca has developed an innovative new fabric called SeaMerino, a world-first blend of ultra-fine New Zealand Merino wool and a seaweed-based fibre called SeaCell. The innovative fibre has been used in Orca&rsquo;s new Restday range of wardrobe basics. When the garments are worn, the active substances in SeaCell are released and work to increase bloodflow, aid skin cell regeneration and quench excess free radicals. They also look cool. Orca has two of these new SeaMerino tops, valued at $179 (short sleeve) and $199 (long sleeve), to give away. <a href=\"mailto:urbanism@agm.co.nz?subject=Orca&body=Name%3A%0A%0AAddress%3A\" style=\"color: #9ccf4e;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: normal;\">Email us</a> with the name of one of Orca&rsquo;s other two Merino ranges (other than Restday).

By tilting and moving the canvas the liquids coalesce and, depending on the relative stages in the drying process the colours blend or separate forming swirling liquid patterns.<br />\n\n				&nbsp;</td>\n			<td>\n				<img alt=\"right hand side image\" border=\"1\" height=\"209px\" src=\"http://gallery.mailchimp.com/610116aa23b00d06b2daf717e/images/art.jpg\" style=\"border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; padding: 2px; max-width: 240px; clear: right; float: right;\" width=\"200px\"></td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n\n</div>\n   <!-- /editable -->\n   <div id=\"content3\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding: 2px;\">&gt;&gt; <a href=\"http://www.gowlangsfordgallery.co.nz/exhibitions/pastexhibitions/2010/chrisheaphy.asp\" style=\"text-decoration: none;color: rgb(156, 207, 78);font-weight: normal;\">Dale Frank at Gow Langsford Gallery</a><br />\n\n</div>\n   <!-- item with righthand image #3-->\n   <!--paid item-->\n   <div id=\"content2\"><div style=\"border-top: 1px dashed rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 0pt; font-size: 11px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\">\n	Sponsored item</div>\n<!-- editable block --><div style=\"border-top: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px; background-color: rgb(232, 232, 232);\">\n	<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n		<tbody>\n			<tr>\n				<td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">\n					<h2 class=\"paid-heading\" style=\"font-size: 14px;font-weight: bold;color: #ffffff;font-style: normal;font-family: Helvetica;margin-top: 10px;margin-right: 0;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-left: 0;\">\n						Studio Italia &mdash; 40% off bedroom furniture!</h2>\n				</td>\n			</tr>\n			<tr>\n				<td valign=\"top\">\n					<img alt=\"left hand side image\" border=\"1\" height=\"124px\" src=\"http://gallery.mailchimp.com/610116aa23b00d06b2daf717e/images/Picture_5.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding: 2px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" width=\"200px\"></td>\n				<td valign=\"top\">\n					Studio Italia is offering 40% off bedroom furniture for the month of August (or until stocks last; showroom display stock only).

Instead, we&#39;ve trawled the website of a shadowy cloister called &#39;Superbrands&#39; for some random info, for instance, Chivas Regal was founded in Scotland in 1909, but originally aimed at the US market; the whiskey hit its straps in the post-war 50s &mdash; &quot;a hedonistic golden age, where parties could last for days&quot;; it was, apparently, a firm favourite with Frank Sinatra; and more recently, in 2009, Chivas Regal sponsored The Black Eyed Peas&#39;, Robbie Williams&#39; (irony on the rocks...?), Beyonc&eacute;&#39;s, and Christina Aguilera&#39;s tours in Asia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to the business at hand. Urbanism has two Chivas Regal prize packs (valued at $60 each) to give away for Father&#39;s Day. So, if your Dad wants to party <del>with</del> like Beyonc&eacute; or Christina all you have to do is email urbanism@agm.co.nz with the answer (and your name and address, so we can come over to your house and ID you) to the following question:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChivas Regal is a whisky produced in which country?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHint: Begins with S, ends with D, and the queen has a holiday house there.<br>\r\nNote: You MUST be over 18 years of age to enter.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- /editable -->\r\n   <div id=\"content3\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding: 2px;\">&gt;&gt; <a href=\"mailto:urbanism@agm.co.nz?subject=Chivas%20Regal%20giveaway.&body=Where%20is%20Chivas%20Regal%20produced%3F%20\" style=\"text-decoration: none;color: rgb(156, 207, 78);font-weight: normal;\">Win a Chivas Regal gift pack</a></div>\r\n   <!-- item with righthand image-->\r\n   <!-- item with left image-->\r\n     <!-- editable block -->\r\n   <h2 class=\"secondary-heading\" style=\"font-size: 14px;font-weight: bold;color: #FFFFFF;font-style: normal;font-family: Helvetica;margin: 25px 0 5px 0;\">\r\n     <!-- editable block -->\r\n     <div id=\"content2\">Sculpted Space<br>\r\n</div>\r\n     <!-- /editable -->\r\n   </h2>     <!-- /editable -->\r\n   <!-- max-width sets image resize constraint when image is uploaded -->\r\n   \r\n   <!-- editable block -->\r\n   <div id=\"content2\"><img alt=\"left hand side image\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://gallery.mailchimp.com/610116aa23b00d06b2daf717e/images/ray_sanderson.1.jpg\" style=\"border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding: 2px; max-width: 240px; max-height: 240px; clear: left; float: left;\">When architecture and art collide you might end up with something like Ray Haydon&rsquo;s sculptures.

Backlit works on paper glow with a soft light of an otherworldly city-scape or microcosmic colonisation.

Bosse, director of architectural firm LAVA, is one of several designers commissioned by the Powerhouse to use a pre-loved chair to tell a story about a piece of furniture they love. He chose a design classic that relates to current design and manufacturing techniques. The gravity-defying Panton chair by Verner Panton was a radical departure from traditional design and manufacturing techniques at the time of its invention. It anticipated the digital revolution by 30 years and is the first freeform, organic moulded piece of furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve chosen to represent this shape as slices, similar to an MRI scan in order to make visible its complex three-dimensional geometry.

Instead, we&#39;ve trawled the website of a shadowy cloister called &#39;Superbrands&#39; for some random info, for instance, Chivas Regal was founded in Scotland in 1909, but originally aimed at the US market; the whiskey hit its straps in the post-war 50s &mdash; &quot;a hedonistic golden age, where parties could last for days&quot;; it was, apparently, a firm favourite with Frank Sinatra; and more recently, in 2009, Chivas Regal sponsored The Black Eyed Peas&#39;, Robbie Williams&#39; (irony on the rocks&#8230;?), Beyonc&eacute;&#39;s, and Christina Aguilera&#39;s tours in Asia.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nBut to the business at hand. Urbanism has two Chivas Regal prize packs (valued at $60 each) to give away for Father&#39;s Day. So, if your Dad wants to party <del>with</del> like Beyonc&eacute; or Christina all you have to do is email urbanism@agm.co.nz with the answer (and your name and address, so we can come over to your house and ID you) to the following question:<br />\n\n<br />\n\nChivas Regal is a whisky produced in which country?<br />\n\n<br />\n\nHint: Begins with S, ends with D, and the queen has a holiday house there.<br />\n\nNote: You <span class=\"caps\">MUST</span> be over 18 years of age to enter.<br />\n\n</div>\n   <!-- /editable -->\n   <div id=\"content3\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding: 2px;\">&gt;&gt; <a href=\"mailto:urbanism@agm.co.nz?subject=Chivas%20Regal%20giveaway.&body=Where%20is%20Chivas%20Regal%20produced%3F%20\" style=\"text-decoration: none;color: rgb(156, 207, 78);font-weight: normal;\">Win a Chivas Regal gift pack</a></div>\n   <!-- item with righthand image-->\n   <!-- item with left image-->\n     <!-- editable block -->\n   <h2 class=\"secondary-heading\" style=\"font-size: 14px;font-weight: bold;color: #FFFFFF;font-style: normal;font-family: Helvetica;margin: 25px 0 5px 0;\">\n     <!-- editable block -->\n     <div id=\"content2\">Sculpted Space<br />\n\n</div>\n     <!-- /editable -->\n   </h2>     <!-- /editable -->\n   <!-- max-width sets image resize constraint when image is uploaded -->\n\n   <!-- editable block -->\n   <div id=\"content2\"><img alt=\"left hand side image\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://gallery.mailchimp.com/610116aa23b00d06b2daf717e/images/ray_sanderson.1.jpg\" style=\"border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding: 2px; max-width: 240px; max-height: 240px; clear: left; float: left;\">When architecture and art collide you might end up with something like Ray Haydon&rsquo;s sculptures.

Bosse, director of architectural firm <span class=\"caps\">LAVA</span>, is one of several designers commissioned by the Powerhouse to use a pre-loved chair to tell a story about a piece of furniture they love. He chose a design classic that relates to current design and manufacturing techniques. The gravity-defying Panton chair by Verner Panton was a radical departure from traditional design and manufacturing techniques at the time of its invention. It anticipated the digital revolution by 30 years and is the first freeform, organic moulded piece of furniture.<br />\n\n<br />\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve chosen to represent this shape as slices, similar to an <span class=\"caps\">MRI</span> scan in order to make visible its complex three-dimensional geometry. The chair is metaphorically and physically carved out of a sliced box &rdquo; says Bosse.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nBosse believes that today we understand better how to derive form from geometry, such as the underlying geometries in nature, and can incorporate buildability into the form from the inception through parametric modeling techniques.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nRe-loved is on display at the Powerhouse Museum until 10 October 2010 during the Sydney Design Festival. </div>\n   <!-- /editable -->\n   <div id=\"content3\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; padding: 2px;\">&gt;&gt; <a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;color: rgb(156, 207, 78);font-weight: normal;\">Powerhouse Museum website</a><br />\n\n</div>   <!-- item with righthand image-->\n   <!-- item with left image-->\n   <h2 class=\"secondary-heading\" style=\"font-size: 14px;font-weight: bold;color: #FFFFFF;font-style: normal;font-family: Helvetica;margin: 25px 0 5px 0;\">\n     <!-- editable block -->\n     <div id=\"content2\">Italian Film Festival<br />\n\n</div>\n     <!-- /editable -->\n   </h2>\n   <!-- editable block -->\n   <div id=\"content2\"><img alt=\"left hand side image\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://gallery.mailchimp.com/610116aa23b00d06b2daf717e/images/giuliadoesntgooutatnight07.jpg\" style=\"border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; padding: 2px; max-width: 240px; max-height: 240px; clear: left; float: left;\">The Italian Film Festival is now New Zealand&#39;s second biggest movie fest, and in 2010 it expands to screen for two-and-a-half weeks in Auckland and two weeks in the six other cities throughout New Zealand, with a gala opening night in each location.

Step forward Jens Sieber, an Audi senior designer who specialises in interior architecture. The 43-year-old switched from product design to car design in the late 1990s, around the time of Audi’s original TT. The simplicity and elegance of that car still excites him, as does the DNA of the brand to which he remains intensely loyal.\r\n\r\nSieber has been crafting the cabin of Audi’s luxury A8 flagship since 2004. His brief: to bolster the car’s sporty, agile character while maintaining a lightness and elegance. No mean feat when you’re working on a two-tonne limo.\r\n\r\nWalking around the car in an Auckland showroom, Sieber points to the shoulder lines of the aluminium body, the traditional Audi proportions (“one-third greenhouse, two-thirds body”), the sloping, coupé-like roofline, and “a slightly dropped tail for dynamic effect”.\r\n\r\nEnter the cabin and eyes are drawn to the sophisticated use of aluminium, leather and wood. The dashboard is very broad but slim, it’s slightly driver-oriented and the side panelling delivers a pronounced wrap-around effect. \r\n\r\n“We aimed for a harmony between sportiness and elegance, between modern features and tradition,” says Sieber. “So it’s ‘loungey’, it surrounds you in a very nice way. It’s luxury but lightweight, not heavy or opulent.”\r\n\r\nThe MMI (Multi Media Interface) touchpad beside the transmission lever “brings another sense to the car, a tactile element”. While driving you can use your idle left hand to scrawl letters and numbers on the pad for navigation or telephone connections. The transmission lever is shaped so that the underside of your wrist rests on it while you use the technology. “It’s another way for drivers to get in contact with the car, another centre of power.”\r\n\r\nSieber stresses that he wanted to make the rear of the cabin as intriguing as the front. “Some buyers will prefer to sit back here. They are a special target group, they will appreciate the special technology, the innovation, so they receive a console with the same infotainment system controls, similar space and plenty of rich materials.”\r\n\r\nThe designer adds that a major challenge in a car like the A8 is “to give the customer the feel that the car is manufactured in a very personal way, like a tailor-made suit. You must give it that richness, to leave almost no wish unfulfilled.\r\n\r\n“Working on flagship cars is fun,” he concludes, “because you can work at a level near perfection.”  *urbis*\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/images/1059.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><txp:thumbnail id=\"1059\" /></a> <a href=\"/images/1060.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><txp:thumbnail id=\"1060\" /></a> <a href=\"/images/1061.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><txp:thumbnail id=\"1061\" /></a> <a href=\"/images/1064.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><txp:thumbnail id=\"1064\" /></a> <a href=\"/images/1062.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><txp:thumbnail id=\"1062\" /></a> <a href=\"/images/1065.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><txp:thumbnail id=\"1065\" /></a> \r\n\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1065\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>  <strong>First impressions, new launches, a coveted interview and a good old fashioned drive – Andrew Kerr does it all.</strong></p>\n\n	<p>You don’t need to be a car nut to know that Audi interiors have a reputation for being benchmarks in quality design.

These terrace houses – rows of dwellings sandwiched between each other – became popular in Europe as a good way of housing workers during the Industrial Revolution. By the Victorian era they were no longer just for workers, and the style had spread to the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe owners of this Victorian terrace in Melbourne had some fairly clear instructions for architect, Matt Gibson, “They wanted to retain the original elegance of the front of the house and continue this through to the rear, only with a more contemporary feel. They wanted to marry the two together but allow the front to retain some of its originality and authenticity.” Sounds simple! \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1069\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nTerrace houses – particularly those built in Victorian times when privacy was a big concern – have ‘compartmentalised’ rooms that are shut off from each other, and this extensive double-storey house at the end of a terrace of six similar houses was no different with poorly-lit tight spaces. To address this, the rear of the house was removed while the front was opened up and restored to its original glory with wooden floorboards, ornate architraves and decorative fireplaces. \r\n\r\nThe house then seamlessly flows to what Gibson refers to as “the more comfortable area,” the kitchen and indoor/outdoor seating area. This is an original part of the property that has been modernised, however there is a nod to the house’s age. Part of the boundary wall has been stripped back to its bare brick, and then covered with ivy. Gibson says, “We liked the effect of a pristine interior looking out over a bare brick wall.”\r\n\r\nGetting light into the house was a challenge; there are high boundary walls and not much access for natural light. Gibson extended the size of the original courtyard, letting light flow in. The courtyard also “becomes a buffer between the old and the new, and while they are connected it helps create a break between them,” Gibson explains.\r\n\r\nThe rear of the house is a new extension and provides a contemporary interpretation of the original house.

These terrace houses – rows of dwellings sandwiched between each other – became popular in Europe as a good way of housing workers during the Industrial Revolution. By the Victorian era they were no longer just for workers, and the style had spread to the colonies.</p>\n\n	<p>The owners of this Victorian terrace in Melbourne had some fairly clear instructions for architect, Matt Gibson, “They wanted to retain the original elegance of the front of the house and continue this through to the rear, only with a more contemporary feel. They wanted to marry the two together but allow the front to retain some of its originality and authenticity.” Sounds simple! </p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1069\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Terrace houses – particularly those built in Victorian times when privacy was a big concern – have ‘compartmentalised’ rooms that are shut off from each other, and this extensive double-storey house at the end of a terrace of six similar houses was no different with poorly-lit tight spaces. To address this, the rear of the house was removed while the front was opened up and restored to its original glory with wooden floorboards, ornate architraves and decorative fireplaces. </p>\n\n	<p>The house then seamlessly flows to what Gibson refers to as “the more comfortable area,” the kitchen and indoor/outdoor seating area. This is an original part of the property that has been modernised, however there is a nod to the house’s age. Part of the boundary wall has been stripped back to its bare brick, and then covered with ivy. Gibson says, “We liked the effect of a pristine interior looking out over a bare brick wall.”</p>\n\n	<p>Getting light into the house was a challenge; there are high boundary walls and not much access for natural light. Gibson extended the size of the original courtyard, letting light flow in. The courtyard also “becomes a buffer between the old and the new, and while they are connected it helps create a break between them,” Gibson explains.</p>\n\n	<p>The rear of the house is a new extension and provides a contemporary interpretation of the original house. Gibson says, “We retained a strongly designated functional programme, yet the journey from front to rear involved a progressive spatial ‘editing out’ – selective removal of walls and breaking down the formality and containment of the Victorian interior.” </p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1070\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Walking through this house is a journey, from the formal front through to the more relaxed middle and into the casual courtyard.

It may seem at first glance somewhat alien but what’s really interesting about this house is its atrium form, a housing type that is well suited to inner city living and that we will be seeing more of.\r\n\r\nBeyond the buttoned-up façade, the crisp salute of the front porch and its big black door, this house bursts into life: three galleries wrapped around a courtyard full of sun and air, but private and quiet as well. The north wing, to the street front, has a guest area above the garage that can in future be adapted into two bedrooms, but you could imagine working from here as well. The south wing is the living and kitchen area with the main bedroom above. The sheer glass sliding doors of all these spaces open up to the courtyard with an uncanny effect like a vast cross section, like a doll’s house with the walls stripped away, reminiscent of Shigeru Ban’s exhilarating Curtain Wall House. The abrupt encounter of intimate interiors with the great outdoors, that we also get under the picnic umbrella, the pavilion or marquee tent has an almost luxurious, indulgent, utopian quality to it. And of course the house’s architect André Hodgskin is also known for his floating retro-modern holiday pavilions, the Bachkit and iPad.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1072\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nIt’s the exquisite attention to detail, in both design and the crisp crafting of the house that really enhances this atmosphere. The building has the qualities of an intricate cabinet full of surprises: doors disappear into pockets, new spaces unfold beyond what seem to be blank walls, cupboards and shelves are suspended above the floor. As one walks through the house one is surprised by the limpid, watercolour quality of light filtered by skylight into what would otherwise be dark interiors. Windows at the ends of galleries, glances outside, borrowed views over the neighbour’s garden make what is a small house feel much more spacious. The house draws you on to explore little pockets of the site. Every possible space on this land seems to have been exploited, every square millimetre utilised. It is a small house, Japanese in scale, but equally subtle, crafted and well thought out, finished in a palette of rich but sober materials.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1073\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nWhat is all the more remarkable in this flexible, adaptable, well thought out house is that André Hodgskin inherited the building envelope from a previously approved resource consent application. He has carved out of that a very successful inner city house, a private world that exists cheek by jowl with neighbours, yet we are quite unconscious of their presence over the boundary walls. Despite what our planning rules have to say on the matter, the atrium house is an ancient urban form and makes so much sense on a small section, rather than the skinny little two-storey houses we build, surrounded by unusable land.

The designer, Vaughn McQuarrie, grew up in Invercargill and was working in Edinburgh when he was commissioned by a schoolmate to design him and his partner a house. \r\n\r\nThe house sits on a section on the edge of a cliff with an outlook of sea, rugged rocks and a quarry. It is at the end of a long drive at the end of a dead-end road on the fringe of Dunedin. This is not a light landscape, and while the more relaxed northern climate may enable a shelter to merely consist of a glass box, the Deep South means that this approach is not really appropriate. A house in Dunedin needs to be a retreat, one that is warm and protective. The house does this, settling into its landscape through the design of a curvaceous concrete retaining wall. The curve, in continuation of the cliffs below – a connection that is observed on approach to the house – signifies a shift away from the other box forms and creates architectural interest and compelling outdoor spaces.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1094\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nThe planning is organised by the establishment of three boxes: a concrete and stone box houses a garage and storage, and two cedar-clad boxes house the bedrooms and living space. Entry into the house is at the intersection of these boxes. This in-between space is sheltered, but the continuation of the exterior cedar cladding intimates that one is not quite inside yet. The acknowledgement and the separation of these pavilions, is resolved by the introduction of a frameless glass window at each of the connection points, also making them weather tight. \r\n\r\nOnce inside, one naturally drifts towards the living pavilion, partly due to its position and partly due to one already having already surveyed the extent of the site and knowing that the best views are in that direction. The living pavilion is a simple space and contains a kitchen, a dining area and a lowered living room. Black rock aggregate from the quarry seen from the site is used in the black concrete floor, and the timber detailing and joinery creates warmth and an inherent connection to the natural landscape. A picture window at the end of this room frames the edge of the land. The green pastures, the cliff face, and the sea are enticing and immediately draw one down into this space. \r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1096\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nTo the south of the living pavilion, McQuarrie has indulged himself with a single glass box. Slightly lowered from the kitchen and dining space, it is a small intermediate space with timber floors and large glass doors that pull back to expose the occupants to the sounds and tastes of the site. Here, one can experience more than the picturesque views and be immersed in a dusting of sea spray and the sound of the wind whipping across the grass. Despite the distances between architect and site during the design phase of the house the result is a house that is very much of place; a place filled with memories. *urbis*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','	<p><txp:if_individual_article><br />\nWords by Peta Nicols<br />\nPhotography Simon Devitt<br />\n</txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p><strong>Vaughn  McQuarrie designed this house in Dunedin for clients while living in Edinburgh, Scotland, giving this modern dug-in home a Scottish connection.</strong></p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1095\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>Bagpipes, landscape, the town plan and now this house are all things that connect Dunedin, New Zealand to Edinburgh, Scotland.

Or so it seemed, by the early years of this decade. He was long gone – to America, the hermetic land of opportunity, from which news of émigré progress escapes as rumour rather than report – but he was not forgotten. Tales of his early career in New Zealand were recounted with wonder and envy. Price cut quite a dash, as a young architect, and certainly seems to have done his bit to make the Sixties swing in Auckland. He was a self-made man in a hurry: he drove fast cars, he sailed yachts, he lived right by the water at Takapuna in a triplex townhouse he designed (one of the other owners was junior beer magnate Douglas Myers). \r\n\r\nSomeone even made a documentary about him. He was a starchitect (locally, at least, and admittedly in a remote galaxy) who already seemed to be living an American life. In fact, if you’d wanted to find an analogue you’d have to done better to consider a Californian self-actualizer like Ferrari-driving Craig Ellwood than any of his compatriots. It comes as a surprise to realise that Price’s golden Auckland season started only a decade after the heyday of the Group Architects, whose modest woody modernism suddenly seemed as exciting as Methodism.\r\n\r\n<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1090\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article>\r\n\r\nIn the span of a few years in the late ’60s and early ’70s Price designed the buildings for which, in his absence, he was remembered. There was Ceramic House in New Lynn (the headquarters of brick manufacturer Ceramco), the Manukau City Council building, and the little circular – actually, 12-sided – tower at 82 Symonds Street (a charming building which has survived the neighbourhood’s depredations). And then there was the slim and eliptical West Plaza, the high-rise on the corner of Albert and Customs Streets.

Or so it seemed, by the early years of this decade. He was long gone – to America, the hermetic land of opportunity, from which news of émigré progress escapes as rumour rather than report – but he was not forgotten. Tales of his early career in New Zealand were recounted with wonder and envy. Price cut quite a dash, as a young architect, and certainly seems to have done his bit to make the Sixties swing in Auckland. He was a self-made man in a hurry: he drove fast cars, he sailed yachts, he lived right by the water at Takapuna in a triplex townhouse he designed (one of the other owners was junior beer magnate Douglas Myers). </p>\n\n	<p>Someone even made a documentary about him. He was a starchitect (locally, at least, and admittedly in a remote galaxy) who already seemed to be living an American life. In fact, if you’d wanted to find an analogue you’d have to done better to consider a Californian self-actualizer like Ferrari-driving Craig Ellwood than any of his compatriots. It comes as a surprise to realise that Price’s golden Auckland season started only a decade after the heyday of the Group Architects, whose modest woody modernism suddenly seemed as exciting as Methodism.</p>\n\n	<p><txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1090\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article></p>\n\n	<p>In the span of a few years in the late ’60s and early ’70s Price designed the buildings for which, in his absence, he was remembered. There was Ceramic House in New Lynn (the headquarters of brick manufacturer Ceramco), the Manukau City Council building, and the little circular – actually, 12-sided – tower at 82 Symonds Street (a charming building which has survived the neighbourhood’s depredations). And then there was the slim and eliptical West Plaza, the high-rise on the corner of Albert and Customs Streets. No commercial client would now countenance a building which so privileges grace over net lettable area, which is why none will produce a building as elegant as West Plaza.  </p>\n\n	<p>Price and his wife Rosie moved to the United States in 1980, to California (of course, one is tempted to say).

Paul’s family were some of the original Colonial settlers in Taranaki, descendants of Frederic Carrington who surveyed New Plymouth, and Paul has been collecting local artists like Don Driver since he first began buying art. The art work isn’t limited to paintings. As well as large sculptures on the deck outside, the couple collect pottery and objects. Various collections – currently Shelley’s new passion is Japanese Sumidigawa pottery – sit in small huddles on tabletops and in corners. It is a trove in the most tactile sense of the word.

And the jarra and kauri trike from Essenze will surely become a piece handed down through the generations. </p>\n\n	<p><span class=\"caps\">LEFT</span> to <span class=\"caps\">RIGHT</span>: Jarra and kauri Tricycle; Highchair by Droog, available from Simon James Design, <a href=\"http://www.simonjamesdesign.com/\">www.simonjamesdesign.com</a> Giddyup Rocking Stool by Tim Wigmore. both Giddyup Rocking Stool <br />\nand Tricycle available from Essenze <a href=\"http://www.essenze.co.nz/\">www.essenze.co.nz</a></p>','','','1102','mag-dispatch','Issue-60',0,'',0,4,1,1,'this_issue','','','toy-story','','','','','','','','','','','2aac467453f76bc56cad66489d70cb76','2011-02-08'),(442,'2011-02-08 09:01:48','andre.kini','2011-02-08 09:43:19','andre.kini','Against the Grain','','<txp:if_individual_article><txp:upm_image image_id=\"1103\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" /></txp:if_individual_article> *Dick Frizzell and Martin Poppelwell have translated patterns developed in their art into fabrics.*\r\n\r\nTwo of the country’s top designers have paired up with two of the country’s best-known artists.

Original artworks by Frizzell and Poppelwell are displayed in the same space.\r\n\r\nArt and design seem natural partners, but all too often there is a friction between the two. Design necessitates function – a purpose, a role. While art too has a role, it doesn’t need to be comfortable, or ergonomic, or even particularly structural (though perhaps large scale sculptors would disagree here). \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"1105\" form=\"upm_img_popper\" />\r\n\r\nWhat is nice about this project is that the art element has not had to move particularly far into the functional world, and neither has the design element lost its purpose in dabbling with decoration. The fabrics, printed with iconic, graphic imagery, are not so different to paint on canvas. Moreland’s Chair and McDonald’s Chaise have retained their design integrity. Art and design have met, and have created something greater than the sum of their parts. \r\nThe Hawke’s Bay has long been a hotbed of design and artist talent in New Zealand, and patrons like Millar Road who foster creative collaborations like this will continue to grow the area’s talent. *urbis*\r\n\r\n TOP: Dick Frizzell hangs an artwork from his recent Phantom series with the design-art collaborations for Millar Road in the background.
