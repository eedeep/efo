Alongside the two-dimensional depictions, a beautiful scale model based on the research illustrations and photographs will also be exhibited.</p><p>Associate Professor Charles Rice received a UTS early career research grant to study Portman\u2019s architecture in 2009, and was assisted in his research by recent Master of Architecture graduate Alina McConnochie.</p><p>Said Rice: \u201cWhat really interests me about Portman\u2019s architecture is the way the interior space develops a kind of urbanism via its circular structure, creating cities within cites without reference to the outside.\u201d</p><p>The Portman spaces are also of contemporary significance, Rice explains: \u201cIn parts of the Middle East, contemporary urban development has amplified this concept on a massive scale, creating enormous closed urban environments. These spaces enable both insulation against the harsh climate and heightened levels of security and control.\u201d</p><p>Rice\u2019s extensive research of Portman architecture has also recently provided crucial information for the US Pavilion exhibition at this year\u2019s Venice Architecture Biennale. A comprehensive three-dimensional digital model of the centre, developed by Alina McConnochie, was used as the basis for Portman and Associates\u2019 own digital modelling of the centre. This enabled them to produce rapid prototype physical models of the Peachtree Centre for the US Pavilion exhibit.</p>",

It examines the relationship between the skyscraper and the natural world, the skyscraper and the community, and the skyscraper and the city.</p><p>The exponential increase of the world\u2019s population and its unprecedented shift from rural to urban areas has prompted hundreds of new developments without adequate urban planning and poor architectural design. The aim of this competition is to redefine what we understand as a skyscraper and initiate a new architectural discourse of economic, environmental, intellectual, and perceptual responsibility that could ultimately modify our cities and improve our way of life.</p><p>The use of new materials, technologies, aesthetics, and novel spatial organizations, along with studies on globalisation, flexibility, adaptability and the digital revolution are some of the multi-layered elements that the participants should take into consideration. This is also an investigation on the public and private space and the role of the individual and the collective in the creation of a dynamic and adaptive vertical community.</p><p>There are no restrictions in regards to site, program or size. The objective is to provide maximum freedom to the participants to engage the project without constraints in the most creative way. What is a skyscraper in the 21st century? What are the historical, contextual, social, urban, and environmental responsibilities of these mega-structures?</p><p>Students, architects, engineers, and designers are invited to participate in the competition.

            "content": "<p class=\"p1\">The Housemuseum challenges the assumption that the home is a private entity, opening its doors to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Music, theatre, painting, sculpture, dance or cinema can become forces that move beyond collective experience and veer quickly into the realm of passion. The possession of art and its visibility are a constant source of debate. While the liberation of high art out of the stately homes of the Victorian era and into the gallery for all to see has its obvious benefits for the general public, it often removes the work from its intended context. Viewing a family portrait in a huge room with thirty other portraits corrupts the scale of the experience and perhaps removes the enjoyment from the education.&#160;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">In the domestic scene, the role of art is often limited to the purchase of a painting for a special occasion, or a print that complements the decor of a room, or perhaps as an experiment in collecting art as a pastime. In recent years, the commodification of art as an investment or as part of a self-funded superannuation package has confused the notion of why you might collect art. At its best, good art is purchased by people who love it \u2013 but how they choose to display it in their private realm is an entirely personal agenda. Far away from the white gloves and stale air of curators and galleries, owners of good art hang it in a manner that allows them to enjoy it every day. Occasionally, generous individuals or families open their homes to the public to allow their collection to be seen. This is important not just because of the chance to see the work, but more critically to see the art in a house \u2013 an intimate, particularly curated personal space.&#160;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Corbett and Yueji Lyon have embraced the proposition to open their home and their collection, creating the Lyon Housemuseum in the Melbourne suburb of Kew. The idea of the Housemuseum is far more eighteenth century than twenty-first. This access to a personal collection of important work has seen many houses around the world become small galleries. The Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum in London, the Frick Collection in New York and, closer to home, John and Sunday Reed\u2019s Heide II at Heide Museum of Modern Art in Melbourne. In each case, the collection has a direct relationship with the architecture, where the complexities of space form a dialogue with the pieces it contains.&#160;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">At the Lyon Housemuseum, it is the shift in scale that is most compelling. The \u201cnormal\u201d function of the house is wrapped around two volumes for art, one black and one white. The black box is closed and almost impenetrable, designed for projection and video work that needs control of light. The white cube is open to light and occupation, with balconies that look down into the space, allowing multiple views of each work. Between these two spaces is a wonderful collection of rooms, some long and thin, some vast and high, some tiny and intimate, all weaving a rich matrix of domestic stuff among the expansive collection of Australian contemporary art. The Australian bit is important \u2013 for over thirty years, the Lyons have systematically collected good Australian art, pieces that have become exemplars of this period in Australian art history. <br />\r\nHoward Arkley, Callum Morton, Patricia Piccinini, Tim Maguire, Peter Atkins and Daniel von Sturmer, to name but a few, are represented <br />\r\nin the collection.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">This is not an ostentatious exercise, but a considered exploration of how a substantial collection of art might be integrated into a residence. The spaces seem in constant flux between the dominance of the art and the prominence of the architecture. Occasionally the balance is uncomfortable, with a piece struggling for room in its host space, but this only heightens the nature of the investigation. Some spaces are purpose designed for an artwork; others welcome a particular scale of work. Integral to this exploration is how the house might function in a public context when opened for visitors or researchers. In response, the architecture carefully considers the privacy of the house\u2019s more intimate points (for example, the bathrooms and children\u2019s bedrooms). The result is a deep plan layered with clever circulation. Elaborate joinery units conceal small works as artefacts, with doors pivoting and panels sliding to reveal the precious contents inside.&#160;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Externally the Housemuseum is a surprisingly restrained object considering the highly expressive institutional and educational work of Lyons, the architectural practice Corbett has with his brothers Carey and Cameron Lyon. Ribbed zinc cladding undulates over a glazed ribbon of glass that connects the sculpture courtyard with the work inside. The perimeter wall of the corner block that holds the Housemuseum manifests the wit of the authors, with the name of the two streets pixelated into the brick pattern.&#160;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">In contrast, the interior is lined with plywood panels that fold from ceiling to wall and into the joinery elements. A texture appears across the ply that, on closer inspection, reveals a collection of quotes, texts and conversations that seems to describe the spirit and process of creating the building. In fact, although it can never be read, the text forms the word <em>art</em>, embedding the intention in the soul of the house.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">This gesture reveals the real tension in this project \u2013 those moments when the architecture is seen as a layer of the artwork. The architecture, through space and material, curates both how the house is lived in and how it aids understanding and, fundamentally, enjoyment of the art within.&#160;</p>",

            "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>We present developed images of the seventeen \u201cWhen\u201d scenarios to be shown in Venice, and Lee Stickells looks at the catalogue to consider these speculations on the future.&#160;</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although I can find no mention of it, I hope the Australian pavilion&#160;</span>at the 2010 Venice Biennale has a snack bar. I\u2019ve only got the catalogue by which to gauge the architecture exhibition, but it certainly looks like Jaffas and choc bombs would be the ideal accompaniments. Now + When: Australian Urbanism is projected (literally) by its creative directors, Ivan Rijavec and John Gollings, as a technologically dazzling display of 3D stereographic images and animation, augmented by an immersive soundscape. Australia\u2019s last biennale outing was about impressing through an \u201cabundance\u201d of architectural models and thinking; this time it\u2019s about overwhelming through \u201cvisceral spectacle\u201d.&#160;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The image on page six of the Now catalogue sums up the approach. It shows a group of architectural illuminati gathered at a preview screening, 3D goggles on; their faces are tilted upward toward the projection out of shot to the right. Something in that combination of the distinctive glasses and posture reminds me of a well-known image of a 1950s cinema audience, all wearing 3D glasses. I\u2019m particularly familiar with its use on the paperback cover to Guy Debord\u2019s <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>. The resonance points me to the most obvious criticism that might be levelled against Now + When: that it is focused on the spectacular, on a distracting, seductive entertainment that works against critically engaging with the issues faced by urban Australia. The suspicion on this count isn\u2019t eased by Gollings\u2019 attempts, on the one hand, to claim a new, revelatory role for the thrilling stereoscopic views he has harnessed and his admission, on the other hand, that such images \u201clie\u201d \u2013 concealing many problems in their distance and sheen.&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nonetheless, it\u2019s hard not to be swayed by Gollings\u2019 enthusiastic and beguiling recounting of the production process (the catalogue essay on this having already been published in <em>AA</em> May/June 2010). <br />\r\nI\u2019m also cautious about pre-empting the experience of the pavilion, based only on the catalogue material available to me. In any case, I\u2019m more interested and concerned with the When material. The speculative architectural imaginary, the utopian impulse that it draws on, seems a pertinent field to engage at this point in history.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When 2050+ was developed through competition, from images and drawings submitted by Australian architects. \u201cVisionary and theoretical approaches, expressing directions and aims beyond current imaginations of the future\u201d were encouraged, and the results are deliberately provocative, even utopian. The catalogue puts it: \u201cThe result has been a cyberspace of creative speculation that oscillates from theoretical approaches to pure fantasy, exploding the urban debate into a visceral spectacle that defies rational analysis.\u201d Beyond the hyperbole, there is a serious and worthwhile impulse at work here. The utopian project is an important means of modelling alternatives to the way things are, in order to force some sort of engagement with them. Ernst Bloch described it elegantly: \u201cUtopian consciousness wants to look far into the distance, but ultimately only in order to penetrate the darkness so near it.\u201d</span><span class=\"s2\">1</span><span class=\"s1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, do the speculative urban scenarios developed and gathered in the catalogue have the power to conjure different worlds? Are they radical in modelling other ways of being, in the face of Australia\u2019s current demographic, environmental, economic, social and political tensions? Yes and no. In his When catalogue essay Craig Bremner suggests the scenarios featured \u201cdo not demand new cities or new urban scenarios. Rather, they ask us to design new living models, new ways of being together.\u201d I would argue that they do the opposite. Overwhelmingly, the catalogue\u2019s collected visions depict urban projects \u2013 city structures, technologies and forms \u2013 that leave social and political transformation, the critical question of structuring how we live together, aside. The images are provocative but the scenarios are often underwhelming.&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The seventeen \u201cgraphic predictions\u201d presented in the catalogue, curated by the creative directors from 129 competition submissions, form an all too familiar ecology of contemporary future-visioning. Like the crowded evolutionary trees for architecture that Charles Jencks created in <em>Architecture 2000 and Beyond</em>, these predictions form a swirling, homeostatic system from the same constituent parts. In various combinations and permutations, we can find: \u201corganic\u201d, algorithmic structures; large-scale public movement systems that negate the car; compact urban forms (typically dense and vertical); urban agriculture; infrastructural mega-structures; renewable energy systems and environmental technologies (for example, solar power and rainwater harvesting); form driven by demographic and environmental modelling; and recognizable tropes of architectural futurism (Lebbeus Woods parasites, Yona Friedman mega-structures, floating cities). Dramatic though the images might be, I find it disconcerting that, if the fantastical forms and airships were stripped away, most of the scenarios would please the average New Urbanist. Is this as radical as Australia\u2019s architecture gets?&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some of the visions are simply dull \u2013 tired Arcadian images or hoary clich\u00e9s that seem neither to offer incisive meditations on Australia\u2019s urban future nor to come close to \u201cvisceral spectacle\u201d. Alternatively, some of the scenarios offer more evocative, open-ended and productive imagery, but only if their scenarios are set aside. For instance, Saturation City\u2019s waterlogged urban enclaves are captured in simultaneously intriguing and disturbing images. These perhaps depict a wildly extrapolated outcome of the fragmentation and privatization already at work in our metropolises. Multiplicity\u2019s evocative topographical layers, floating over Melbourne\u2019s city centre, might be populated by all sorts of unforetold, parallel societies. However, the scenario text is corralled in an imaginary assembled from this year\u2019s concerns: media screens, mass transit, urban agriculture and renewable energy.&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As Aaron Betsky has put it: \u201cArchitecture is a fiction \u2026 Some of the most powerful pieces of architecture do not exist in buildings. We inhabit them through stories, whether they are myths, fiction or poetry.\u201d</span><span class=\"s2\">2</span><span class=\"s1\"> The problem for Now + When is that, for all the elaborate drama of the presentation techniques, the narratives are too often leaden. Why is this, and what is the significance? It may be worth considering that what is often most revealing about utopian vision is not what is said (or shown) but what cannot be said \u2013 \u201cwhat does not register on the narrative apparatus\u201d.</span><span class=\"s2\">3</span><span class=\"s1\"> For an exhibition at an international biennale, which aims to represent the very best of Australia\u2019s architectural thinking (and, presumably, a distinctively Australian mode of thinking), it is telling that the suburb is largely absent from the scenarios. Despite Australia\u2019s essentially suburban (rather than urban) quality, the focus is almost entirely on city centres. The suburb is quietly sidelined in these visions; it is ignored, superseded by dense urban form or replaced by verdant landscape. It is a lacuna in the overall discussion that points to the most contentious, and undoubtedly important, urban debate Australia must have.&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One scenario that does offer something like a suburban vision for Australia\u2019s future is Symbiotic City. Tellingly, it draws on the writing of William Gibson, adapting&#160; it to elucidate the continuous carpet of intertwined rural and urban that makes up \u201cNew Hobart\u201d.</span><span class=\"s2\">4</span><span class=\"s1\"> This is the most evocative and exciting text in the catalogue:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201c<em>Swift had</em> walked slowly forward, into that neon maw and all that patchwork carnival of scavenged surfaces, in perfect awe. Fairyland. Rain-silvered plywood, broken marble from forgotten banks, corrugated plastic, polished brass, sequins, painted canvas, mirrors, chrome gone dull and peeling in the salt air. So many things, too much for the reeling eye \u2026 <em>A becoming-familiar juxtaposition</em> [\u2026] In the distance a wingless carcass of a 747 housed the kitchens of nine Thai restaurants.\u201d</span><span class=\"s2\">5</span><span class=\"s1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gibson\u2019s work demonstrates the power of speculative fiction to extrapolate from current conditions and hypothesize new ways of being together. The recent tradition of urban re-imagining that Gibson sits within (J. G. Ballard probably its most well known figure) has also had a powerful influence on the way architects speculate about future urban landscapes. This relationship points to what I anticipate is the best way (should any of us get the chance) to view the Now + When exhibition in all its 3D stereoscopic glory: accompanied by some serious speculative fiction. Don the active shutter goggles to enjoy the thrill and dynamism of the When projections, but read some Ballard, Gibson or Neal Stephenson in parallel. My suspicion is that the juxtapositions will be more inspiring and the experience more provocative. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Lee Stickells</em> is a senior lecturer in architecture and urban design at the University of Sydney.&#160;<br />\r\n</span></p>",

The question for architecture centres on the problem of spatially supporting planned research as well as serendipitous exchange.</p><p>The Lowy Cancer Research Centre was won by Lahz Nimmo Architects in association with Wilson Architects, through an invited competition process. Wilson Architects\u2019 contribution was focused on satisfying the first ambition, the provision of quality laboratories to facilitate research \u2013 the practice previously worked with John Wardle Architects on the Queensland Brain Institute. Both the Lowy and QBI are primarily laboratory buildings (the Lowy has four floors of P2 laboratories) and both buildings benefited from Wilson Architects\u2019 expertise in the sensible resolution of parallel zones of equipment, benches and write-up. The researchers I spoke with are happy with the flexibility and operational aspects of their laboratories and the ease of moving between floors via an internal P2 lift and stairs.</p><p>To fulfil a laboratory classification, solar penetration is strictly eschewed in the designated spaces and the decision was made to keep the band of equipment to the north and write-up to the south of the laboratories. Consequently, researchers always have the relief of a pleasant view of a mature garden \u2013 a view enriched by stepping up the ceiling height to the south, making large full-height windows possible. The southern facade is an attractive composition of glazing and vertical bands of green aluminium composite panel, while the northern facade, protecting the equipment rooms behind, is heavy and less visually satisfying. Unhelpfully, the project floor area increased by 30 percent during the design process, and this eliminated any potential for setting the northern facade further back from the street. Attempts to relieve the overall bulk with punched out rooms are further compromised by the incomplete state of the project. The adjacent Faculty of Medicine building will soon be renovated \u2013 again by Lahz Nimmo in association with Wilson Architects \u2013 and this includes a new facade to the north that with luck will see the public face of the building better resolved. In its current state it is somewhat schizophrenic; the public face of the project is at odds with its welcoming and lively interiors.</p><p>The challenge of getting around four hundred researchers, led by professors who are regularly out of the building and in the hospital, to intermingle is the key ambition of the project and it is in these attempts to sponsor conviviality that the building gets interesting. Firstly, the project substitutes monumental and complete form for a more porous and open-ended architecture with physical links and views to other buildings on and off campus.

In its current state it is somewhat schizophrenic; the public face of the project is at odds with its welcoming and lively interiors.building form is literally and metaphorically concerned with connection and bridging. Secondly, the project thickens and augments the corridor \u2013 the traditional space of academic socializing and gossip \u2013 using it to form a distributed network of informal kitchens and lounges, semi-open-plan work areas and programmed event spaces. The core of these informal social spaces bridges the upper levels of the new building with the old Wallace Wurth Medical Faculty and takes a diagonal path between the two that approximates a natural inclination for walking. Forming an inhabited bridge, this is in turn used to frame what has become a major pedestrian entrance to this end of the campus, as well as to both buildings and the Michael Birt Gardens beyond. With its foyer and circulation located adjacent to the existing medical faculty (rather than at the west end as originally briefed), the project has been able to generate a positive experience of social exchange between new and old elements, but also in and out of the campus. The connection between UNSW and its context is more than symbolic, for the relationship between clinical and academic work is close.</p><p>The foyer is an expanded space that reaches vertically through the six floors of the building, its perimeter shifting to introduce a dynamic of interpenetration. From the photographs I anticipated that the foyer would be a monochromatic space of green, green, green. In reality, there is a lot of green, but it is balanced by planes of white, walls of timber, dark grey floors and furniture that introduces orange and brown. Indeed, there is a remarkable attention to delivering a tactile, colourful and carefully thought through interior of purpose-built cabinetry and flexibility. The vibe is that of a bar and lounge, not an institution devoted to science and bench space, yet these are bars and lounges that can easily be reconfigured for presentations and meetings, and are equally comfortable for a lone researcher with her sandwich.</p><p>It has been evident since the beginning of the project that the success of Lahz Nimmo Architects and Wilson Architects\u2019 winning proposal lies in a clear organizational schema that manages to encompass the strategic ambitions of the university as well as the detailed technical requirements of the researchers. The key elements \u2013 views to the gardens, intense use of circulation as a social condenser, upper-level connections to the Wallace Wurth and a skewed western end that addressed the campus and a major eastern entry \u2013 have survived negotiation and compromise and, more specifically, the builder\u2019s value management process. Materials and details have changed to accommodate the demands of value management, but it is only in the northern facade that one feels that this has in any way lessened the outcome. Most importantly, the informal social spaces that are typically the most vulnerable to pressures in the process from briefing to occupation (given that they do not have a quantitative brief) have been preserved and are working. In similar research buildings it is almost always the informal and formal social spaces that users complain about \u2013 atria that are too cold, hot, noisy or exposed to comfortably lounge in, reading and discussion areas with empty shelves that were meant to be shared libraries, kitchens that remain unused. For the Lowy Cancer Research Centre, these spaces have been so successful that the users immediately exceeded the provision of refrigerators. It is a credit to the architects that they are now designing additions to the kitchens to accommodate their popularity.</p><p>Sandra Kaji-O\u2019Grady is professor of architecture at the University of Sydney.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Responding to the environmental and client context of each project, this practice has an expanding folio of individualized homes.</strong></p><p>While only in their mid thirties, Albert Mo and Eid Goh, the directors of Architects EAT, have been running the firm for more than a decade. The practice was founded by Albert and Eid and a third director, since departed, after studying together at the University of Melbourne.</p><p>Their priorities were clear from the beginning. \u201cWhen you start an architectural business, you have to decide early on if you want the money or if you want the reputation,\u201d says Albert, laughing. \u201cYou can\u2019t really say both. But while sustaining a little income, one big thing we said to ourselves was that design is important.\u201d Years later, this focus on design has seen the firm develop a reputation for finely wrought houses that are paradoxically novel and yet reliant on fundamentals that would make an old architect smile.</p><p>Individual houses are important to the practice, although they also work on commercial and higher-density housing projects in Australia and abroad. \u201cHouses have an intrinsic quality,\u201d explains Albert. \u201cA client comes to you and entrusts their life savings. In each single house our motivation is what we can explore, how we can explore the ideas we like.\u201d</p><p>And what of those houses? The first EAT project to gain press interest was Albert\u2019s own extension to his older house in the inner-Melbourne suburb of Richmond (Kelso House). \u201cWhen you are doing your own house, a lot is about the budget. At that time we really didn\u2019t have too much money, but we still wanted to do something special because it was a vehicle for us to show our design. A lot of ideas came through, but of course a lot of ideas also mean money. It became an interesting project by distilling the ideas, pared back down to the essential things that we wanted, to maximize the potential of the site.\u201d</p><p>The signature feature of this house is the horizontal strip skylights in the living space. \u201cIn this case we wanted to bring natural light deep into the house. It\u2019s a Corbusian idea, registering the light as the day changes.\u201d The success of this feature has seen it resurface in later houses.</p><p>Light remains a preoccupation in general, and their Hawthorn house plays with light both internally and externally. I ask about other common threads in their work. Albert replies that \u201cone thing we talk about early on, in housing projects, is the response to the context. Not just the physical context, but the human context. The client may be a really flamboyant person, for example, and their personality is always ingrained. The way the client talks, the way they present themselves, really influences the mood of the project.\u201d</p><p>In the Windsor Loft project, Albert and Eid were deeply influenced by the client\u2019s photographs and furniture, sculptures and art. They were also struck by the extroverted way their client presented himself, and this too fed indirectly into the project, perhaps most notably with the choice of the striking red plastic facade.</p><p>The Elm and Willow House had a very different client, with a very different result. The project is an extension to a typical double-fronted Edwardian and the renovation takes the form of a U-shaped, glazed, steel and concrete pavilion wrapped around two existing trees. \u201cThis client was \u2018design mature.\u2019 The project was for a young couple with a two-year-old child. One of the couple is an industrial designer, very aware of design in an international sense. They talked about projects by John Pawson and Tadao Ando. Normally if you say concrete in residential you would be fighting a battle, but not in this case.\u201d</p><p>The solution for the couple was to provide a living and kitchen space in the rear, as a contrast to the darker, more enclosed Edwardian at the front. In keeping with the couple\u2019s interests, the living spaces are non-traditional in the sense of being relatively \u201cunprogrammed.\u201d \u201cInstead of a living room with a television, they have deliberately decided to have just a couple of low seats and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s very improvised.\u201d This client was also \u201chappy to forgo the desire for multiple bathrooms\u201d and other typical trappings of the contemporary house. As associate James Coombe would later say in response to a question about trends they had observed in house design, \u201cWe try to push a slightly alternative lifestyle, I guess.\u201d The Elm and Willow House certainly meets this criterion.</p><p>A new project at Skenes Creek required a similar editing of the client\u2019s requirements. The so-called Puzzle House led the team to question the real needs of the occupants of a holiday house. \u201cHoliday houses always seem to come with a massive brief. We said, hang on \u2013 you go there maybe five days a month, why do you need to live like you are in the suburbs? So the whole house is small, 7.5 by 7.5 by 7.5 metres.\u201d</p><p>My conversation with the Architects EAT team is a relaxed affair, and there is a palpable sense of ease between the three architects at the table. I have a glimpse of what it must be like to engage them as a client. Eid expresses it simply. \u201cWhoever comes in, we treat them the same. You just be as humble as you can.\u201d</p><p>I discover that this attitude also applies to their sub-consultants and the builders who create their projects. \u201cWe definitely have to collaborate with the builders on our projects. The concrete at the Elm and Willow House is a good example \u2013 luckily the client was keen on prototyping, as we and the builder hadn\u2019t done it before. The engineer also played an enormous part.\u201d</p><p>Albert points to this as a generational characteristic. \u201cThe difference is that the older generation of architects were the ultimate head of construction, up there ignoring advice from the builder, and our generation is more about learning from people who actually use tools every day, who have the craftsmanship to put things together. I mean, we have differences, but 70 percent of the time I would say that they are right.\u201d</p>",

Her working process \u2013 characterized by play, experimentation and concentrated looking \u2013 takes her from sculpture to functional object, from tiny to hall-sized. Since moving away from full-time architecture several years ago, Waterson has concentrated her considerable creative energy on her own practice, which is a happy mix of architecture, sculpture and object design. The Bloom Series is the most recent result of her explorations \u2013 a group of homewares and furniture pieces that continue to unfurl, to bloom, from a palm-sized, three-sided, generating object she has called a \u201cpixel.\u201d</p><p>The Bloom Series was born out of a group exhibition where each contributing artist was required to depict his or her own shape or silhouette. Ever willing to submit herself to artworks \u201cthat nearly kill me,\u201d Waterson handmade a suspended silhouette of herself constructed from 700 polypropylene pixels. Inspired by the results, she ramped up the scale. Working with pixels thirty centimetres high, Waterson built a suspended, sculptural ceiling.</p><p>Inevitably, out of this process of crafting the same object over and over at different scales, other forms emerged. Working with what Waterson calls \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d forms of the pixel, she clustered, sliced, mirrored and stretched to create different objects at different scales. So far the Bloom Series has unfurled a small, faceted metal vessel entitled Clove that is fabricated from a split female form, and an elegant ply fruit bowl \u2013 \u00bd Tilt \u2013 made from a lateral split in a cluster of female forms. Mirroring the form of the fruit bowl created a dynamic magazine rack entitled Tilt Form and stretching the geometry of this shape upwards created a ply stool with a faceted, concave seat, Lift Stool. The ceiling has rotated to become Pixel Screen, made from recycled corflute, and a series of richly coloured objects, Fruit Pixels, comprise the baby of the range. Made from recycled, coloured acrylic, the spiky, jewel-like objects nostalgically recall a collection of coloured glassware owned by Waterson\u2019s grandmother.</p><p>For Waterson the Bloom Series is a deliciously infinite project that offers her a vehicle with which to explore the boundaries of particular materials, to build collaborative relationships with local fabricators and to exercise her mind when looking to the next shift in geometry or scale.

            "content": "<p><strong>The Australian dream of home ownership has not traditionally embraced prefabricated housing, but could the move toward sustainability change that? This discussion is followed by a presentation by Arkit on the prefabricated EcoStudio that was recently on display at Melbourne\u2019s State of Design festival.</strong></p><p>Our love of real estate has traditionally focused on detached houses built on separate, usually quarter-acre, blocks of land. Solidity and permanence are important qualities \u2013 brickwork is the preferred material, even if only for the outer, visible layer. Size is important too \u2013 the bigger, the better, of course. And styles, at least for the ready-built market, tend to speak of our colonial past or our romantic ideals of European landscapes (Tuscany is the usual favourite). Lightweight construction might be tolerated for a holiday house \u2013 a beach shack in Australia or a \u201cbach\u201d in New Zealand \u2013 while apartments are considered an investment or an option for retirement. This love of houses has meant that while Australia is an urbanized country, its cities are low-density \u2013 some of the lowest in the world.</p><p>This creates two key challenges for improving the sustainability of the built environment. First, to improve the efficiency of water and energy collection and use in suburban houses. This is being done \u2013 if slowly \u2013 through incentives such as rebates for rainwater tanks and solar hot water systems. Second, to improve the efficiency of the infrastructure that serves these houses. This means making better use of transport, energy and water networks that are already in place, rather than building new ones. The way to do this is to increase density: to use activity centres and urban infill to create smaller, more connected dwellings that celebrate moderation. And prefabrication might just be the way to do it.</p><p>Houses are not like other consumer goods. While modern architecture changed the appearance of the built environment, it didn\u2019t have the same effect on the building industry. The advantages of production-line factories and global supply networks that brought appliances and other goods into our homes had much less effect on the homes themselves. It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying: the twentieth century is filled with experiments in factory-built housing, the most notable being Buckminster Fuller\u2019s Dymaxion, all promising to make houses as easy to buy as a motor car. But, while owning a motor car was considered a sign of prosperity, living in a prefab house was not. Their small size and lightweight materials spoke instead of welfare austerity, and their portability implied they were in constant danger of being repossessed.</p><p>But today\u2019s prefabricated houses are different. No longer resembling mining site sheds, they are increasingly being designed by groovy young architects. Playful variations of an overall rectilinear geometry \u2013 amenable to factory production \u2013 give design identity similar to that achieved through mass customization. Renewable materials dominate, resulting in a mix of industrial and eco aesthetics. Factory production means minimal waste, while portability is a useful feature for a generation familiar with nomadic work practices and cheap global travel. Modules are usually small, enabling efficient energy and water use. More importantly, site installation means energy, water supply and waste disposal can be facilitated either through network services or on-site systems. This can make the users more aware of \u2013 and responsible for \u2013 the ongoing resource usage in a way that might not happen with \u201cburied\u201d services.</p><p>Housing affordability is a key issue \u2013 prefabricated houses might be the best way for the next generation to get into the market. Instead of buying house and land packaged together (either from a developer or as an existing dwelling), home owners might buy a prefabricated house and then lease a site to live on. A whole new market could emerge as the yards of suburban Australia are made available to tenants able to bring their own home with them. Alternatively, eco-villages could be created for new home owners to occupy until they could afford their own site. Around activity centres or along existing transport corridors, sites could be made available above existing commercial or light-industrial sites.</p><p>Prefabrication provides an opportunity to improve the environmental performance of new houses. It can provide smaller, more efficient homes to meet the demands of a growing population, a new way to change the rules of home ownership and, more importantly, to increase the density of our cities.</p><p>The Australian dream of home ownership has not traditionally embraced prefabricated housing, but could the move toward sustainability change that? This discussion is followed by a presentation by Arkit on the prefabricated EcoStudio that was recently on display at Melbourne\u2019s State of Design festival.</p>",

Arkit designs and manufactures factory-built buildings using a sustainable wall-panel system, which provides integrated insulation to protect the interior environment from thermal variation while also providing structural stability to ensure a durable building.</p><p>The Arkit construction system utilizes the natural properties of timber in manufacturing \u2013 it is lightweight, it uses off-the-shelf standards and practices, it has lower embodied energy and lower carbon emissions than other common building materials, and it is economical, renewable and harvested from a sustainable source. Each panel and window interlocks to form a rigid wall system. Constructed in a factory, each panel is crafted to precision tolerances and quality standards.</p><p>The Arkit panel is manufactured using unused short lengths of western red cedar as the external cladding \u2013 a sustainably managed natural resource with exceptional beauty, built-in resistance to harsh environmental conditions and inherent insulating properties. This is combined with a plantation-harvested hoop pine plywood interior lining to create a building that sits harmoniously in its environment.</p><p>The Arkit is economical and takes a fraction of the normal time to manufacture, deliver and erect. It offers clients a sustainable architectural solution where design, time and budget expectations are known prior to the installation of the building, offering a certainty and quality that are sometimes missing in traditional construction processes.</p><p>The EcoStudio is just one example of a building built using the prefabricated Arkit system. This single-bedroom fifty-square-metre building is assembled in our factory and delivered to site complete with kitchen, bathroom and all the wiring and plumbing ready for connection.</p><p>An integral part of the design is its environmental engineering, starting with the variable services hub at the rear of the building. The hub is fully accessible and contains the hot water unit, electrical meter and switchboard, grey water system and telecommunications node. The hub can also accommodate options such as a solar hot water unit and solar electricity to suit the local and specific client requirements.</p><p>The EcoStudio can be engineered to respond to different climates and to adapt to the absence of civil infrastructure, providing intelligent options for sustainable living. The sustainability strategy and philosophy for adaptable building infrastructure has been developed in partnership with Tai Hollingsbee of GHD. It represents a considered, integrated approach between architecture and engineering as an exemplar of sustainable design.</p><p>GHD optimized the building envelope in response to detailed thermal, energy and comfort analysis of the building design. The life-cycle cost analysis shows a marked benefit in long-term running costs for the building over traditional building alternatives. This adaptable building systems strategy can also enable off-grid installations with the potential for an independent, zero-carbon mode of living.</p><p>Arkit standard passive environmental features include external sunscreen devices concealed in the external walls of the building, cross-flow ventilation, double glazing and insulated floors and ceilings. The EcoStudio displayed at this year\u2019s State of Design Festival in Melbourne featured a green roof provided by the School of Land and Environment Green Roof Research Program at the University of Melbourne, which is ideal as a way of limiting solar gain and mitigating stormwater run-off and air pollution in urban environments.</p><p>The EcoStudio in standard specification is expected to achieve a First Rate 5 rating of 6.1 stars in Victoria \u2013 well ahead of current standards and above the requirement for 6 stars for all new residential buildings in 2011. The EcoStudio is envisioned as a residential accommodation for the urban backyard or rural block, for temporary accommodation, weekenders, eco tourism and for home office or studio environments.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>On a ridge near the old country town of Wingham floats a bold and simple home that is the architect owners\u2019 perfect hang-out.</strong></p><p>It\u2019s not every day that architects have the chance to design purely for themselves. The NSW-based husband and wife architectural duo of Russell and Carolyn McFarland spent years designing other people\u2019s homes before they began their own, but the time was well spent.</p><p>\u201cSometimes we draw things that we don\u2019t really agree with because it\u2019s the client\u2019s particular wish,\u201d says Russell. However, that process has been helping them \u201csubconsciously develop ideas\u201d of how they\u2019d do their own place. When the time came, those ideas were \u201csomewhat solidified and quite happily very similar between Carolyn and myself,\u201d Russell says.</p><p>The result is a home they love. One of the nice surprises for the McFarland family is how easily they can spend the day in and around the house, drifting in and out.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get cabin fever as we\u2019ve found in other, more traditionally built houses we\u2019ve lived in,\u201d says Russell. \u201cIt\u2019s just a nice house to hang around in.\u201d</p><h4>Light and simple</h4><p>From the outside, Tallowwood Ridge Residence presents as one clean skin punctured by very dramatic and wide linear openings. It seems to float above the slope.</p><p>\u201cOne consistent thing in our work is the way the building is articulated over the levels, which allows the upper, lightweight, inhabited section to float over that solid foundation section,\u201d says Russell.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s expressed in materials and colour. Lightweight materials allow you to be much more expressive with openings \u2013 and larger scale openings \u2013 than if you had brickwork.\u201d</p><p>Russell points out that a lot of the innovations in their designs aren\u2019t space-age technologies, just the refining of traditional materials into something that\u2019s sustainable and increasingly useful.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t go for a lot of fancy materials. We use direct, available and practical ones, partly because they fit into people\u2019s skill bases,\u201d Russell says. \u201cYou\u2019re not paying through the nose for specialist trades. And that covers everything, from cladding to window technology developments. It\u2019s low-tech and simple.\u201d</p><h4>L over square</h4><p>While the materials the McFarlands favour are low-tech and simple, there\u2019s a trend in their designs to create buildings with long rectangular footprints instead of square ones. This means there\u2019s a greater surface area to floor area ratio, which can be more expensive to build.</p><p>To help compensate, the overall size of the McFarlands\u2019 home was based on the sizes of the panels of Scyon\u2122 Matrix\u2122 cladding used for most of the exterior. This meant the frame construction was more efficient, as it was based on the joints of the cladding, as well as reducing panel wastage.</p><p>\u201cThe dimensions of the building are almost a module of the panel,\u201d Russell says.</p><p>He feels that the benefits of the rectangular plan outweigh the negatives, if you can afford it.</p><p>\u201cIt means all the rooms have greater access to light and ventilation. In this instance the L-shape, with its greater exterior facade area, also worked better on the block. We find they generally do, because you\u2019re not putting a dumpy square on the block, leaving you with the marginal gaps around and a rectangle to the rear.</p><p>\u201cIf it then means that the area of the house itself is smaller to compensate for that greater surface area, then all the better!\u201d</p><h4>Design Awards</h4><p>Tallowwood Ridge Residence was an entrant in the 2010 Look Home Green Design Awards, created to recognise and reward the best in sustainable and affordable residential design across Australia.

            "content": "<p><strong>The architecture of then and now is fused with a blend of excitement and assured restraint at this reimagined homestead in southern Tasmania.</strong></p><p>Trial Bay House is exceptional on several levels. Located on a rural property south of Hobart, overlooking Bruny Island and the D\u2019Entrecasteaux Channel, it is sited in the teeth of the sublime.</p><p>James Jones, a former director of Hobart firm HBV Architects, has carried out a complete reorganization of an existing dwelling, designed nearly forty years ago by Ray Heffernan. He has added a new living pavilion and garage, enlarged a small courtyard and converted a verandah into a glazed corridor room.</p><p>The architecture of then and now is fused with a blend of excitement and assured restraint. The new \u201cchannel room,\u201d separated from the main house, is an abstraction in precast concrete of a cinematographer\u2019s camera. This linked pod pays homage to absent friends who knew how to maximize the impact of a magnificent site, Le Corbusier and Luis Barragan.</p><p>Steeply pitched gable roofs of the original house have been retained. The contrasting architectural styles of raw concrete orthogonal geometry appended to the old \u201chomestead\u201d form of painted masonry, elegant and iconic, is arresting upon arrival. A long and circuitous driveway sweeps out of the trees and the house is suddenly before you. The siting of the addition thrusting towards the view has the significance of a sacristy linked to a cathedral, a renaissance assertion of the major building\u2019s \u201cGothicness.\u201d</p><p>The channel room provides an extra living space, offering sanctuary to parents if the impact of teenaged children is temporarily dominant in an open-planned house. It is equipped with a north-facing, openable glazed wall to admit the sun in winter. A panorama of Bruny Island and the D\u2019Entrecasteaux Channel through the east wall is uninterrupted by window framing but punctuated by the trunk of an adjacent blue gum, a Zen concession to the all-encompassing. A flat ceiling, white like the room\u2019s lengths of solid wall, gives this extension to the main house\u2019s living/dining space a subtle sense of exclusivity. You have arrived in the physically separate channel room, at the view, at the house\u2019s inner sanctum.</p><p>The east-facing major wing of the original house has been transformed by James\u2019 determination to enhance the spatial integrity of the interior architecture. Stripped of non-essential walls and built-in patina, the naked interior may have been in danger of becoming a cavernous antechamber to a view. In fact, the opposite effect has been achieved. Architectural possibilities have been realized despite the view.</p><p>Stained boarding lining the steep inner pitch of roofs has been retained, as have exposed and stained timber trusses. The original clinker brick walls have been hard-plastered and painted warm white. Internal space has thus been polarized \u2013 dark above the wall plate, light below except for the gable walls, which are also white. In the light zone are the superbly crafted and understated celery-top bookcases, benches and other built-ins, the furniture, the view.</p><p>Modest window openings have been converted into extensive glazed segments, openable and site-embracing. It is when the large, beautifully made, double-glazed, timber-framed sliding doors are open that the building is best able to concede its debt to an extraordinary location.</p><p>By introducing light and dark spatial zoning, the interior volume of the major wing (living/dining areas, kitchen and master bedroom) is both unified and humanized. In-slab heating generates a comfortable ambient warmth, which is boosted by heat from a polished limestone, sheathed-glass wood stove centrally located. &#160;Cross-ventilation is achieved by opening full-height vertical grille slots integrated into the sliding door frame system. Grey quarry tiles line floors throughout the building. Restrained elegance is everywhere manifest, often expressed in sparse touches of human occupation (woodblock prints, ceramics, weeping courtyard trees) for a Japanese feel.</p><p>A secondary wing with loft extends back at right angles from the point of entry. A verandah running along the north and west faces of the original house has been enclosed using the openable glazing system. The resulting corridor room, flat ceilinged and quarry tiled, overlooks a delightful white pebbled courtyard and provides access to a laundry, two bedrooms (one in the loft), a guest WC and the link to a new garage sited to the wing\u2019s south. On the west face the corridor room becomes an enclosed extension of the courtyard.</p><p>Trial Bay House embraces the visual appeal of a magnificent site while asserting a respectful presence in its privileged location. This reinterpreted residence achieves architectural integrity externally by announcing itself as a confident and dignified human-made component in the landscape. Internally it is superbly detailed, beautifully crafted and spatially exciting. An acceptable level of environmental performance has been achieved without remote control. The finished project is emphatic in its assertion, \u201cmoney well spent.\u201d</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>An intricate patterned pergola cleverly adapts a Queensland outdoor living concept to the Melbourne climate.</strong></p><p>When Fiona Dunin of FMD Architects designed the extension to her brother\u2019s house in Brunswick, in order to achieve all that he wanted and keep the construction under budget, they came up with an ingenious plan. Rather than reduce the scope of the works, they divided the job into two parts. They would leave the aesthetic centrepiece \u2013 the pergola \u2013 till later and get a professional builder to do only the simple box-like extension. The pergola they would build themselves! \u201cA builder would look at the drawings and think&#160;it was really complicated,\u201d says Fiona, and \u201ccomplicated\u201d equates to \u201cexpensive.\u201d So, with her brother acting as the owner-builder, and Fiona\u2019s husband working as the carpenter, the extended family chipped in together to finish the job.</p><p>\u201cThe pergola is the piece that connects the inside to the outside,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cThey live outside a lot.\u201d Her brother\u2019s in-laws live in Queensland and they visit there regularly and enjoy the outdoor lifestyle. The pergola, with its open trellis walls to allow cross-breezes, would sit comfortably in a subtropical context. The design cleverly adapts a Queensland living concept to Melbourne weather conditions. Instead of creating a cool, shadowy space, the roof is clad in translucent sheeting, with the geometric trelliswork acting as an additional filter to the light. A portable gas heater provides winter warmth for cooking and entertaining outdoors, and the sealed roof traps warm air.</p><p>Stage one involved the builder knocking down the old lean-to out the back and building two new bathrooms and a north-facing, open-plan kitchen-living-dining room. An open slot in the pergola roof allows winter sun and year-round morning sun to enter the kitchen space. \u201cThey both get up early, so light was important,\u201d says Fiona. The slot also acts as a marker for the informal entry to the house. \u201cNo-one uses the front door; all their friends come up the side,\u201d she explains, and this is how we approach, two dogs barking and licking at us enthusiastically. Walking down the side of the house is where you first encounter the aesthetic device that elevates this project above a standard builder\u2019s extension. &#160;The offcuts from the laser-cut plywood trelliswork are stuck to the wall in an asymmetrical composition that increases in density as you approach the pergola. Fiona calls it \u201cembossing.\u201d</p><p>The pattern itself was inspired by the idea of a French stocking being pulled over a leg and the way it expands into a diamond grid. Fiona describes it as one of \u201cmany pattern templates that we adapt to each project to create a tailored response.\u201d On another project they might manipulate the density and openness to control sight-lines for town planning regulations. This time the pattern is made denser to hide downpipes and the box-gutter on the roof, and opens up to let in light and breezes. The truly miraculous aspect to this simple technique is the degree to which it works as camouflage for the crude structure that supports it. If you look carefully you can see the cheap, standard timber studs and noggings, the metal cross-bracing and the roof beams, all painted the same green-grey, yet the whole effect is of beautiful visual complexity. The translucent roof sheets give a soft ambient glow. In the evening concealed lighting creates a diffused effect, without casting shadows, subtly transforming the pergola\u2019s appearance.</p><p>The laser-cut panels were the last things to be installed. After a quick measure up of the naked structure, the CAD files were emailed to the laser cutter with a request to keep the offcuts. The extended family came to paint them, which was a big job. \u201cEven my five-year-old daughter helped out,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cThe whole \u2018owner-builder\u2019 thing is a lot harder. I think everyone who tries it learns to appreciate builders more and the costs involved. But it worked out pretty well.\u201d The doghouse will be the next stage of the project \u2013 it too will receive diamond-pattern offcuts and a matching paint job. Even the landscaping contractor has been inspired. The last stage of works will extend the pattern into the garden.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A grand old Edwardian in Melbourne\u2019s suburbs has been respectfully renovated and extended, each room given a distinctly different scale and character.</strong></p><p>Is there any ground more wedded to the idea of the suburb than the hallowed terrain of Melbourne\u2019s Grace Park Estate in Hawthorn? Here the decorative effects of \u201cblood and bandage\u201d brickwork, lacework verandah trims and terracotta tiled roofs have been nurtured for a hundred years. The idea of house as a perfectible, controllable universe is palpably present. But look a little closer and here and there you see evidence that the way we live now is transforming these nineteenth-century ideals. The architects describe a planning regime that \u2013 quite properly \u2013 seeks to preserve the illusion of a suburb in aspic, while clients seek spatial extensions that defy the old divisions between inside and outside. Australian houses are now routinely the largest in the world, preparing for climate change by incorporating within their shells almost everything that was once in the gardens, from the drying of washing to the riding of tricycles.</p><p>What has happened here? The original house has a corner lot configuration: an L of garden surrounds a central gabled entry porch flanked by gabled bays. The landscape architect (chosen because of his Lilliputian work on the Ian Potter Foundation Children\u2019s Garden at the Botanic Gardens) has evened up the two arms, fencing off a Leunig-like play garden at one end, and has located a turning circle on the diagonal of the block. Two small islands of grass surmounted by bottle trees flank the entry porch, looking for all the world like a pair of spectacles. And indeed, on entering the house, there has been much Alice in Wonderland scale shifting. Grand though the existing spaces were, they were connected by mean standard doors. The openings have been hugely enlarged and extended so that once inside you feel suddenly much smaller, as if you have popped through the front door into a TARDIS. Working back from sight lines that preserve the illusion of Edwardian splendour outside and in, the architects have then carved out oodles of space. During design they thought of this as \u201cstealth\u201d operation. The form \u2013 in abstract terms \u2013 streaks away back from the front like a stealth bomber. It is sheathed in copper, startling at first but already in a warm partnership with the existing brickwork. A double-height library is incised between the front rooms and an existing music room at the rear. Through this descends a staircase that seems to hang from the new space upstairs, as if let down as undercarriage to the \u201cbomber\u201d that has settled above. This effect is achieved by locating trusses in the walls of the library void and having them carry the hidden beam from which the stair hangs. Upstairs there are bedrooms, walk-through bathrooms, walk-in cupboards and a long laundry. The plan is cleft: a roof light to the new centre of the house defines the base of the cleavage. Between the two wings \u2013 one for parents, the other for children \u2013 is a deck overlooking the swimming pool. On this deck a large deciduous tree in a pot will cast its shade.</p><p>Let\u2019s go back to the entry. At your left, through the palatial new doorway, is a study with a concealed cellar and operations room. Ahead of you the old reception rooms are linked by wide openings. As Louis Kahn might have put it, these rooms are at last what they always wanted to be. The hall leads you past the library incision, towards what at first sight seems to be a wide outside plane. A curving timber wall eases you from the hall into a space that again makes you feel that you have had a nibble at one of those mushrooms that had such dramatic effects on Alice. This is not really a room at all, but a very deep verandah, where \u2013 as in some tropical houses \u2013 regardless of the formal naming of the enclosed rooms of the house, everyone lives. Certainly it is glazed in, but at a touch of a button blinds glide up; with a little effort the glazing opens and there is a continuous flow to the lawn and pool beyond. <br />Floating magically on this neutral plane is a cloud-like object, around one lobe of which six children can sit to do their homework. In another lobe is a sink and at the further end a meal can be prepared within easy reach of the capacious pantry lurking behind the curving timber wall. A jumping castle of beanbags faces a TV, inviting release when homework is done. Beyond is the quiet dignity of the music room held down by a grand piano.</p><p>At the rear is a small circular lawn arranged in rings like a target. From here you take the money shot of the house. A place to stand, G&amp;T in hand, and think, \u201cYes! This is our idea of a house.\u201d</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A glazed pavilion overlooking the Tasman Sea is pared back to its essence, making for a perfect holiday house.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for a seaside town in the off-season. There&rsquo;s something about the low skies and grey seas, the cold and empty streets, the shuttered windows. Approaching this Merimbula beach house by car, we&rsquo;re greeted by a &ldquo;boarded-up&rdquo; facade of grey timber &hellip; an archetypal off-season moment. This rectangular form is the lower floor of the house, half buried in the sloping site. Above is a glazed pavilion, but with its generous setbacks and grass-fringed decks this element is barely visible and we are introduced to the house as a closed timber box.</p>\r\n<p>On closer inspection it is evident how active this timber box is. The skin of horizontal blackbutt boards folds back to reveal the windows to three bedrooms across the frontage and forms a pair of hinged doors that open onto the compact garage, responding to the activity within the house. But this is winter, the house is closed and the artful grey of the timber facade recedes into the earth and blends with the weathered timber and grasses of the garden.</p>\r\n<p>From the street there are two access paths to the building. On the left is the steep and narrow driveway that leads directly into the garage, housed within the lower level of the house. On the right a stepped pedestrian path accesses the front door on the upper level. These dual points of entry denote different ways of engaging with the house and demonstrate the functional divide between the upper and lower levels. On the one hand, the publicly accessible pedestrian path skims past the lower level to the living, dining and kitchen pavilion, which opens onto panoramic views of ocean, displayed like a spectacular artwork through full-height windows. But we experience the other entry, through the garage, which provides direct and intimate access to the private spaces of the bedrooms and bathrooms, and passes (conveniently, after an eight-hour drive with two small children) the laundry. Complementing the approach into the house through the front door, this entry strikes you as entirely suitable for the dumping, disrobing and shedding that follow a trip to the beach.</p>\r\n<p>The north and south elevations of the upper level are frameless glass, without mullions or openings to interrupt the panorama. The glazing returns around the room&rsquo;s corners to maximize the solar access of the northern aspect and the views over the Tasman Sea to the south. The expansive view is compelling, filling the room, day and night. But the upper level is not a pure modernist glass pavilion. The glazed ends are offset by solid timber walls to the east and west, which embrace the internal stair and open onto the generous deck that rims the upper level to the west and south. These walls are lined internally and externally with blackbutt, the weathered external faces recalling countless humbler beach houses.</p>\r\n<p>Not that there isn&rsquo;t an engaging modesty to this house. Huw Turner from Collins and Turner explains that the client decided early on in the design process that the house would be commercially rented, as well as acting as a family holiday home, and while this variation of brief didn&rsquo;t affect the compact planning of the house, it did influence the spare choice of materials that comprise the exterior and interior palettes.</p>\r\n<p>Huw describes the robust material aesthetic of the building by comparing it to an access path to the beach, an appropriate metaphor for a house that provides the critical link between the urban world and the natural environment for its holidaying occupants. Bleached or weathered timber, concrete and neutral colours predominate. Sealed concrete floors are used throughout the entire house (warmed in the winter by in-slab heating). The ceilings of the lower floor are the painted soffits of the slab above, sliced through with slots that conceal simple fluorescent battens. Brick walls in the bedrooms are painted white and paired with solid and simple blackbutt joinery. Painted brick extends into the surprisingly large main bathroom, which is made more generous by a mirrored end wall. In the bedrooms a couple of hooks suffice for hanging space. Everything about the house, both spatially and materially, has been pared back to its most basic essence.</p>\r\n<p>This sparse palette and its disposition is a reminder that this is a holiday house. The materials are not Spartan, but nor are they familiarly domestic. Other moments reinforce this sense of being removed from the quotidian, even in the off-season. The kitchen has been deliberately designed without a single full-height cupboard, allowing the view to dominate the space. Bar fridges might not work for a family home but when you&rsquo;re on holiday, bending to reach the milk bottle is a play-off you&rsquo;re willing to make in order to have the uninterrupted view. Conscious design decisions such as these pervade the house, creating its air of considered informality. And who needs more than a hook for their clothes when you&rsquo;re on a beach holiday &hellip; in winter?</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>A historic stone barn has been sensitively brought back to life as a one-bedroom dwelling in the old farming district of West Hobart.</strong></p><p>Peppered within large suburban blocks lining the hills of Hobart are grand homes, often barely visible at the end of long lanes. These homes reflect Hobart in the opening decades of the colony, when farmers and wealthier colonials built residences away from the dirt and smell of the settlement. Such historic remnants are relatively easy to find and heritage laws now protect them. Harder to discover are the more lowly outbuildings, particularly if they have lost the home to which they belonged. Tucked away behind a Federation terrace, this stone barn is one such building that has been sensitively brought back to life with a refurbishment by Maria Gigney Architects.</p><p>Leaving one builder speechless and making another swear violently, the barn presented to Maria was literally falling apart. Rising damp, rapidly deteriorating stonework, an earthen floor, every wall out of square and a noticeable lack of footings were features that might well make a builder swear. On the other hand, the little barn excited the heritage experts, as there is a reasonable chance that it is one of the earliest stone structures remaining from the days when West Hobart was a farming district. While it is currently unlisted, all parties involved were keen to retain the best qualities of this heritage building.</p><p>Not only did Maria happily take on this tricky project, she also cannily uncovered the potential to stratum title the property, significantly increasing the value of the rear section of the site containing the barn. This move increased the value of the renovation and made it into the project it has become. She also coerced the right kind of builder to patiently love the building back into shape.</p><p>Working predominantly within the existing six-by-four-metre internal footprint of the building, Maria and the builder have crafted a one-bedroom dwelling over two floors, solving a series of problems along the way. The first issue was the earthen floor and rising damp. The solution was to cap the damp at the base with one hidden slab and one polished slab and detail throughout to set any new work away from the walls, allowing the masonry to breathe. The next and rather substantial obstacle was an inability to insulate the stone and brick walls present on three sides of the building without lining the interior and hiding the texture of these materials. Similarly, Maria did not want to conceal the existing aged roofing timbers. The resolution was to build a steel frame within the masonry walls that supports a new floor and heavily insulated roof. The new roof sits over the old as if part of the original structure, without applying any structural load to the aged rafters. In addition, all openings were double-glazed.</p><p>With the main problems solved, the remainder was all about designing for a clever fit into the small space, imbuing every decision with the desire to retain the original qualities of the building. To provide a little extra breathing space, Maria has stretched the building on the approach side to make a sky-lit entry. Lined internally and externally with vertical timber, this elevation pays homage to the original cladding. The very solid matching entry door disappears into the cladding with a soft click, transforming the alcove into usable space. The heated, polished slab of the entry extends to encompass the kitchen before giving way to a raised timber floor for the living space. Rising through the building is a joinery \u201ctower\u201d that provides storage on both levels and, most importantly, accommodates all of the services so that the walls can be left free of any form of conduit or pipe. The stairs spring from the living level, rising behind the service core with lush, solid timber treads. Other new finishes throughout are either timber or tile. A dark stain is generally used for horizontal surfaces, to match the original timberwork, while natural oak is reserved for floor planes.</p><p>Like any good piece of urban weaving, the success of this renovation is about knowing what to hold on to and what to let go. Luck would have it that all parties \u2013 client, architect, builder \u2013 were in agreement about the division between these aspects of the project, so that the end result feels contemporary while still exuding some of the character of a small outbuilding. Importantly, they all shared a desire to really engage with the process of recycling and reuse. Wherever possible, not only the shell but timbers and salvaged bricks have found their way back into ceilings, paving and furniture, such that little of the original building has actually left the site. Even items of glassware and crockery, found under the earth floor, have become a framed art piece for the living space. Herein lie the seeds of genuine sustainability.</p>",

This time, all the products were designed to create a unified \u201cscene,\u201d as Daniel puts it. Exhibiting in London, \u201cwe were blown away by the reaction,\u201d says Emma. \u201cPeople started saying \u2018I want to stock that in my store,\u2019\u201d adds Daniel. \u201cIt got more real. We started it for fun, but now people wanted to invest money.\u201d Solids is now in the process of being manufactured in China, a somewhat frustrating procedure because of the lack of face-to-face contact. While waiting, they decided to design a range that could be manufactured in Australia \u2013 Basics. \u201cWe tried to reduce the amount of labour per object,\u201d explains Daniel, \u201cand in some ways this dictated the forms of the objects.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cledge\u201d is so called because it is made from two pieces of pine glued together and is only ninety millimetres wide. The cone-shaped lamp is turned from a solid pine block and it\u2019s a surprise to discover it is so hefty and thick. The brass weights are precision-cut from standard extrusions and are extraordinarily heavy, even surprising Daniel and Emma. Their first prototypes were about four times the size. \u201cThe rectangular prism was like a brick,\u201d says Emma. \u201cYou could have killed someone with it.\u201d The circular mirror has a bumpy aluminium surface, whose soft reflection reminds Daniel of early mirrors in Europe.</p><p>\u201cWe design around the way things look,\u201d says Daniel. \u201cWe just like very clean, simple things,\u201d adds Emma. They are enjoying the slower pace of Adelaide. It suits them. \u201cIt\u2019s not too fancy,\u201d drawls Daniel. \u201cNot too fancy,\u201d echoes Emma with a laugh.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>The honest, refined nature of this house at the headland of Port Phillip Bay responds to the owner&rsquo;s love for Scandinavian design.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The residents of this quiet, tree-lined road in one of Victoria&rsquo;s coastal communities have had their peaceful world turned upside down. Since the demolition of an old asbestos cottage on the southern side of the street and the erection of a new house in its place, there has been a marked increase in traffic. For the family concerned &ndash; a couple and their two young sons, who live here permanently &ndash; the stream of people driving past to gawp at their new house has become something of a joke. Luckily, an automated, battened driveway gate keeps the curious from wandering in to take a closer look, but it doesn&rsquo;t prevent them from craning their necks over the top to take snaps.</p>\r\n<p>All this attention is flattering, concedes the house&rsquo;s architect, Peter Woolard of Geelong-based practice Studio 101 Architects. &ldquo;But more importantly, half of those people might never have looked at architecture before,&rdquo; he says philosophically. &ldquo;So if this project means that they start looking at it, talking and thinking about it, then that&rsquo;s a great thing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The north-facing house is the boldest architectural expression in the street to date. It is also one of the few eye-catching contemporary houses in the small beachside town at the headland of Port Phillip Bay, so no wonder it is drawing crowds. It stands on a large, rectangular block of almost 900 square metres that slopes down from the southern rear boundary to the street frontage. The architects took advantage of the sloping site, slotting the rear end of the single-storey house into the hillside, close to the back fence. This created room for a double-car garage and a studio to be tucked underneath, separated from each other by the centrally positioned entry.</p>\r\n<p>From the street the house&rsquo;s elevation is imposing. The main living area cantilevers out over the recessed garage, cocked on a slight angle to face due north and frame views into the canopies of large, old eucalypts fringing the block.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If we had put a deck on the front, there would have been issues of privacy,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;Plus decks tend to be cluttered with outdoor furniture so that you lose the sense of floating and elevation when looking out from the house.&rdquo; Instead, he put the deck between the primary living space (a combined kitchen, dining and living area) and the rumpus room at the rear. Wedged between the two, the central deck provides a sheltered, sunny outdoor area that acts essentially as an internal courtyard and third living space. This arrangement also maximizes winter sun penetration into both living rooms and facilitates easy cross-ventilation. &ldquo;It allows the house to breathe,&rdquo; says Peter.</p>\r\n<p>Running through the house and the courtyard deck is a spine wall of blond concrete block that fulfils a number of functions. As well as providing thermal mass, it clearly separates the western living side of the house from the central corridor and the private sleeping and bathing wing that runs parallel to it, to the east. Starting outside as a two-storey element, the block wall borders one side of the primary living area, where it contains a fireplace as well as niches for built-in furniture. A bank of full-height joinery along the opposite side of the room houses food preparation areas and extra storage. When all the cupboard doors are closed, the kitchen virtually disappears.</p>\r\n<p>Continuing through the courtyard, the block wall incorporates an outdoor fireplace and a barbecue before it ends in the rear rumpus room, where again it contains a niche for a built-in entertainment unit. The various fireplaces and niches emphasize the wall&rsquo;s depth and solidity, as does the opening from the corridor into the front living area. When crossing this threshold, the robust essence of the house is clearly apparent.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m influenced by mid-century modernism adapted to meet today&rsquo;s needs,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;An expression of simple forms and a limited palette of natural materials used in a careful, considered way are the style&rsquo;s key features, with materials left to age and patina over time. I hope this house doesn&rsquo;t always look so new, but weathers gracefully.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The honest, pared-back nature of the house is also due to the owners&rsquo; love for the clean lines of Scandinavian design. They are gradually filling the house with carefully selected pieces that underline the building&rsquo;s quiet strength.</p>\r\n<p>The brief &ndash; more functional than aesthetic &ndash; was for a relaxed family beachside home that wasn&rsquo;t overly large or showy, with plenty of storage and two living areas. The result is much more than the sum of those words. It is a warm, inviting space, filled with sunshine and buzzing with the energy of the young family who live there.</p>",
